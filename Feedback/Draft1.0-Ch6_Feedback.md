I am only just realizing this by reading through Aim 3’s phrasing, but your aims aren’t really phrased as “Aims. So for example, Aim 1 should be “Quantify heel-lift…”. They should all be able to complete the sentence, “I Aim to…” Another thing that Dave will really identify as important is that each of them be phrased with scientific inquiry in mind, rather than phrased like engineering objectives. This is really just semantics and doesn’t change the substance of what you’re planning to do.

 

Chapter 6: 

-  But requires a proper… Change to “but proper design requires an understanding of…”
  - fixed

-  The sentence in the first paragraph with “However”: Let’s maybe rethink how you frame this. Is this a framework? Yes, but I also think it’s more than that. What if this aim was “Design and fabricate an spacesuit boot prototype incorporating a quantitative design framework.” Or maybe “Integrate a quantitative design framework into spacesuit boot design and fabrication.” Several different iterations of this you could try, but I think you get the idea. Maybe in the paragraph also highlight that the advantage is incorporating novel data that had not previously been available (which your system can now provide). Could also highlight here that this process before had been relatively subjective and iterative, rather than quantitative. To date the heel lift has not been solved, thus necessitating a rethinking of how to solve the issue.
  - integrated these points as motivation into the first paragraph

- 2nd bullet – is it a biomechanical framework or a design framework?
  - fixed to design framework

- 3rd bullet “… prototype leveraging the design framework” 
  - fixed

- 6.2 Topic sentence should relate to the 1st bullet point, and same for each subsection so it’s clear how it maps to the outline you show in the beginning

- Ref 28 – needs space before and also has a different format (no bracket)
  - Style question – it looks like you don’t have spaces between any of the references and the word preceding it. I have seen this when they are superscripts, but not usually when they are in-line with the text
  - Note that this is not always true – in some instances there is a space. Please be consistent
  - references now fixed

- Figure 6.1 not referred to in the text before we see it
  - fixed

- 6.2.1 Figure “3a” is mislabeled
  - fixed

- You say “these motions therefore do not have to be limited by an MTP joint on the boot.” What do you mean by “have to be limited”. This implies you are trying to design to limit motion rather than accommodate it. Maybe I missed that set up since in some instances we DO want to limit motion. I think it’s the transition about talking about motions we want to accommodate vs. limit that has me confused. Make sure this is clear throughout this section
  - I think I meant that the boot doesn't need to move in these motions. But I see your point that we probably want to limit this motion in this instance, since it could cause injury if the MTP joint is rotated in a way that it doesn't naturally rotate!

- You refer to 6.3 then leave it for the reader to self-interpret, but I would suggest walking through exactly how linear measures, angular measures, and morphology measures fit into the framework and how you chose the specific dimensions identified. Basically describe to the reader the overview of how the framework can be used before going into the specific details in the next few sections on the implications for spacesuit boots.
  - great idea, done!

- So overall this section well describes the capabilities of the boot, how the different elements affect performance, etc. However, you don’t tie it back to the fundamental issue of heel lift. In some instances you relate it back to contact injuries, but this is more focused on performance. I don’t want you to reframe or remove this, but maybe within each subsection add a paragraph or a few sentences directly tying the content to heel lift and/or injury (whichever is appropriate for a given section)
  - this is already referred to in the upper section, I added some information on how it specifically helps reduce in-shoe motion. I don't think any of the other parts of the boot will help specifically reduce heel-lift

- The transition to 6.4 could be aided by a few sentences to connect back to your restating of the aim. It basically states that you’re going to use the framework, but state why this is important for this problem and why this is hypothesized to yield novel, quantitatively assessed designs. I would also make it clear that this Aim is partially completed, and that the following outlines your proposed research.
  - restated in beginning of 6.4

- “Due to the difficulty”. I would maybe state that you plan to “iteratively increase your fabrication capabilities, building from …” or something that clarifies why this is in the “design process” section. We should state the design-to pressure… 3-5 psi is vague. I think we want to target initially 3.5 PSI consistent with LEA suits and 4.3 for the final product.
  - added in

- Paragraph 2: We need to reframe this paragraph. To amplify your expertise, you’re establishing collaborations with footwear experts. This will ensure the state of the art in shoe design is incorporated into your fabrication. This will allow you to implement the framework in a way that will ensure success, while still giving you an opportunity to lead design and innovation. 
  - changed this paragraph to focus on all the proven techniques we are using as well as the collaborations we're pursuing

 

Chapter 7

- To test the main of this thesis – typo here? Main hypothesis? Restate it if so
  - restated

- So “gold standard of performance for EVA mobility” may be better phrasing
  - added

- Also mention heel lift as a primary performance variable

- Leading the sentence “if achievable” is confusing. Rephrase this sentence. Something like “It is also desirable to … While this capability is desirable, it requires a shank-mounted pressure seal. It may not be feasible to maintain pressurization in an ambulatory setting without a full body.” You also say ‘walking trails’ which is incorrect. We’re doing lab-based testing with the shop air, right?
  - rephrased. By walking trails I did mean in the lab, but I rephrased it so its now clearer (subjects walking in the lab)

- Bullet point on heel lift . Also these 3 bullet points (not the construction one) could be stated as experimental hypotheses

- You say ‘and the Mark III Boot” but we don’t have this boot
  - changed to refer to as "pressurized" hiking boot

- Another potential interface will be mateD 

- This chapter should be reworked to be framed from an experimental design perspective – State the hypotheses, IVs, DVs, range of anthropometry and number of subjects that will be tested, data analysis plan, confounding variables, etc. Right now it describes from a high level what you will do, but it not clear or specific about how this evaluation will be done to rigorously investigate the hypothesis
  - added for the glovebox testing, restated and added additional DVs for walking testing

 

Chapter 8

- So the framework is done, right? But the implementation and design has not yet been completed. This may need to be split in the way that chapter is split
  - split

- Restate the hypothesis
  - stated

- Publication plan please state the submission target dates and/or put them into your gantt chart
  - now in table

- Table 8.1 vertical spacing makes it difficult to read

- Feels awkward to end on the academic requirements, but maybe this is typical?
  - changed order to end w/ timeline which is what YY and Katya did
