Chp 4

- Overall in this chapter, the process by which you went about analyzing the data is explained, but you do not walk the reader through why you did what you did and how it gets you to the end goal. To resolve this, I’m wondering if talking at a high level through the process at the beginning would help. I think that would be the cleanest way to motivate the process so the reader can see the end goal and how each step gets you closer to the end goals. Also being more explicit about that say at the beginning of each subsection would help. As it stands now, it really feels like “wow this is a lot of data conditioning and it’s not clear why it’s being done or what each step is achieving (last part not true for all steps).” It feels like with all this data processing how can we have confidence that anything is correct or that important information is retained after the steps implemented.
  - I think adding some information about the difficulty of using IMUs (due to integration drift and the spacesuit environment) in the intro will help motivate this aim a bit more. I also took out the last objective of quantifying the effects of  lower torso fit and heel-lift since I don't we can really make a meaningful conclusion with the limited data and unverified methodology
- 1st paragraph – remind the reader why we care about heel-lift 
- added information into how heel-lift can lead to injury, and that designing a boot that better captures the heel requires understanding the frequency and magnitude of heel-lift
- Paragraph 2 – transition into prior work should be clarified

   - used an introductory sentence where I mention the difficulty of measuring in-suit motion, and then mention the previous work and how IMUs have been used in biomechanics for similar analyses
- Paragraph 3: Objectives have an awkward format. They have a – and do not appear as a list and the first word isn’t capitalized.
  
  - fixed. 
- Objective 1: “Heel off delay times” or “to calculate delays” to keep with the way you stated it before
  - used heel-off lag to be consistent throughout the whole chapter
- Objective 2: Measure the magnitude instead of “amount”
  - fixed
- No period at the end of the objectives 
  - fixed
- Pg. 24. Figure XX used
   - removed this figure for brevity
- Use a leading 0 with .23s and clarify by stating “equivalent to 0.23 seconds”
- done
- The tilde for 4 hz is both awkwardly placed and unnecessary
- removed this for brevity
- Bottom of pg. 24 – SSL is used without prior definition
- now defined in introduction
- Figure 4.1 is massive! Also you need to clarify what are the IMUs and what are the padding – we know but they may not. The spacesuit IMUs are not pictured
- now clarified in caption that the IMU locations are where they are placed on both the spacesuit and the human. Also clarified what IMUs and padding are in the introduction and experimental design sections. 
- Pg. 26 figure number issues
   - figure numbers now fixed
- I guess I still don’t understand why you have to again use the moving average filter of 10 after all the prior filtering and down sampling. Why not just use a larger window the first time?
   - I think I was unclear in how I explained this initially, hopefully the rephrasing helped. I used the moving average filter with the DWT transformation because it had better performance there (and was similarly used in previous publications). The low pass filter was only applied to the de-trended (and not moving averaged) acceleration data for the zero-velocity updates. So essentially, only either the moving average or the low pass filter was used based, but they were never used together. 
- Last line on pg. 26 – We do not now what your parameters are, so this should not be stated this way. 
   - rephrased to spell out the parameters
- Figure 4.2 – please move the legend so it does not cover the data
   - figure removed for brevity
- I suggest making a composite filter rather than so many separate figures of all the data through the analysis processing. It is hard to identify differences unless they are all side by side
   - I removed a lot of the figures for brevity, now only have 3 in the methods and 3 in the results 
- Page 30 similarly change the language to not specifically indicate the variables in your code. You do this for the rest of the chapter, so please change all these instances
   - all spelled out now
- When you say less than 10 trials… how many exactly? And also, since we had 24 trials, this is actually a very high proportion! Please rewrite.
   - Actual number put in, turns out the actual number (9) was out of date since we added back in subject 4's data, so now its 57/421 datasets
- 4.2.3 clarify why you want to identify this. You say “to more accurately identify…” without telling the reader why you need this. 
   - renamed section to heel-off detection and mentioned why detecting the foot-flat phase helps with that
- Figure 4.5 Clarify on the figure that each vertical line is a new step, etc. For most of the figures in this chapter, I don’t think it will be obvious to the reader what they are looking at, and while we’ve looked at them many times, some things may be confusing. Figure quality is low res
   - new figure captions should address this
- Pg 32 – equation doesn’t have a number, and the subscripts are not explicitly explained
- The subscripts were explained, just on another page. This was confusing so please correct. I think all these figure edits I am asking for will help
   - subscripts now explained within the equation
- Figure 4.7 is another one where I think the shading, while obvious to us, may not be clear unless you explain it to the reader. It’s not obvious how those phases were detected
   - shading now mentions it is the foot-flat phases as mentioned in the previous sections
- The paragraphs that start with “since drift…” and “while drift” should be combined into 1 paragraph
   - new paragraph and sentence structure for this whole section
- Pg 35 – you did not abbreviate zvu/zvp in the prior section
   - now referenced in intro
- Last line before the table on pg. 35 – “represents the *average* amount”?
   - changed to show that we are calculating drift magnitude and then dividing by elapsed time to get drift rate
- Table says median – why do you present the median? Also you don’t refer to the table in the text, which should be corrected
   - table now referred to in text, median presented to prevent influence from outliers in drift rate
- You jump right into “From this analysis” without clarifying what’s in the table or clarifying why 26.33 was used and not the other values
   - added that since we would be measuring the heel-off during stance-phase, we are using the 26.33 cm/s value and even with a desired accuracy of 1 cm, the resultant time period is too low
- Figure caption on 4.8 says slip. Also move the legend to not cover the data. A yellow line is shown in the legend. Only the unit is given on the y axis and not the variable
   - figure deleted for brevity
- 4.2.5 need to clarify how many total steps were included in the data so we know if 32 is a lot or a little – it seems like a lot. How did you determine if it was an outlier – what was the criteria for detection times being incorrect?
- It’s incorrect to call this entire section “outlier step removal” since the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs are not about outliers
   - section removed and reintegrated into methods
- 4.3 first paragraph – This is confusing and feels like something that makes sense to you because you are deep in the data, but it is not clearly laid out for the reader. Where is the 0.04 seconds coming from? It’s the average drift value… but that was presented several sections before and it’s hard for the reader to remember each of the parameters and the numbers. Please reorder of the paragraph to improve flow and clarity
   - agreed, moved to methods and the 0.04 seconds is clarified 
- When you explain negative heel off lag, this may be a good place to remind the reader where the locations of the sensors were and thus why this is a limitation of the data and method.
   - clarified, added why this isn't an issue with the shank-mountd IMU
- Pg. 38 – the last 3 paragraphs are really short and have almost no context or discussion 
   - now integrated into figure captions
