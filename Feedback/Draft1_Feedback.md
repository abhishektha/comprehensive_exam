Intro

·     Pg 1 seems like formatting is off. Says “author year” and 1 only

·     Pg 2 formatting on names is right justified – is that correct?

·     Pg 12 – Formatting again with a line and “1”

 

Chapter 1: Motivation

·     In the paragraphs in the 1.0 section, I feel you often finish with the topic sentence instead of end with it. I’d suggest focusing on aligning the point of the paragraph with a strong intro as well as a strong summary.

·     Instead of “thermal environment” maybe “extreme environmental temperatures”

·     “In addition, the planetary atmosphere…” – Rewrite to say there is no planetary atmosphere. Also you say “prove life support” instead of provide

·     That Apollo 17 fact is crazy!!

·     “Ambulation is one of…” is a bit of a non-sequitur. It’s not clear if the objective of this paragraph is to say how little experience we have or that ambulation is important. 

·     There is no transition to section 1.1, it just goes right into injury without priming the reader for this section. This is also needed to give context as to why you’re discussing injuries. As written right now, it’s a good lit review, but it has not yet motivated where the thesis is going

·     “Poor indexing can require increased exertion to move the joint” This sentence feels like it’s appended on without adding to the argument or furthering the commentary

·     This section has no final paragraph. This chapter should really use this content to motivate what you’re trying to solve and state that. You don’t want to wait until the end of the background section to make it clear to the reader what problem you are trying to solve. 

 

Chapter 2: Background

·     So overall I feel several of the paragraphs in this section have the same issue as the prior chapter, namely that it’s not clear what the arguments are from section to section. It’s a nice thorough review, but please review all topic sentences and closing sentences to ensure the material builds to your intended point.

·     “much more walking” Yes – but also the Apollo astronauts loped. Maybe to get around this we say “ambulation”? Or “traversing”?

·     “Higher incidence rate” add the “than” – microgravity, than the EMU, than whatever you think is the most appropriate one to throw in

·     Next sentence is awkward “While these specific injury…”

·     Mobility features – not only to maintain constant volume but also because they create points at which the suit can buckle more easily (this is from thin wall pressure vessel models)

·     2nd paragraph “mobility design features” needs a topic sentence

·     More context on Z2 – developed by whom and when and why? 

·     “Subjects still reported..” Clarify by saying “In fit checks” Or “design performance testing” etc.

·     2.3 is “Spacesuit mobility” sufficient? What about “Planetary Spacesuit Mobility”?

·     The difference between spacesuit mobility and spacesuit ambulation is ambiguous . While different, they do not seem like the need to be separate sections. For example section 2.3.1 could easily go in the ambulation section

·     2 periods right after “gravity levels”

·     There seems to be too many subheadings – 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 could all be combined into a section discussing performance

·     2.4 – do you want to add your figure here that shows indexing, fit, and pressure leading to injury?

·     Typo “movethe”

·     Figure 2.1 is way too large – I think this is a formatting error; same for 2.2
