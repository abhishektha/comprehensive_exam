Intro

·     Pg 1 seems like formatting is off. Says “author year” and 1 only --removed

·     Pg 2 formatting on names is right justified – is that correct? --this is how it is on the CU thesis template. Also no idea why the Dr. is missing before your name, since its in the Latex file but somehow gets deleted with the PDF

·     Pg 12 – Formatting again with a line and “1” --trying to fix, I think it might just be CU thesis template

 

Chapter 1: Motivation

·     In the paragraphs in the 1.0 section, I feel you often finish with the topic sentence instead of end with it. I’d suggest focusing on aligning the point of the paragraph with a strong intro as well as a strong summary. --Tried to implement this in all the paragraphs, and used the summary sentence to transition to the next paragraph

·     Instead of “thermal environment” maybe “extreme environmental temperatures” --done

·     “In addition, the planetary atmosphere…” – Rewrite to say there is no planetary atmosphere. Also you say “prove life support” instead of provide --done

·     That Apollo 17 fact is crazy!!

·     “Ambulation is one of…” is a bit of a non-sequitur. It’s not clear if the objective of this paragraph is to say how little experience we have or that ambulation is important. --removed the sentence and added to the previous sentence to highlight how the requirement is doubling 

·     There is no transition to section 1.1, it just goes right into injury without priming the reader for this section. This is also needed to give context as to why you’re discussing injuries. As written right now, it’s a good lit review, but it has not yet motivated where the thesis is going --added information about the shift to microgravity EVAs and the high incidence of injuries that followed from it 

·     “Poor indexing can require increased exertion to move the joint” This sentence feels like it’s appended on without adding to the argument or furthering the commentary --removed and reframed indexing as a whole

·     This section has no final paragraph. This chapter should really use this content to motivate what you’re trying to solve and state that. You don’t want to wait until the end of the background section to make it clear to the reader what problem you are trying to solve. --added, talked about how EMU injuries are focused on upper torso but planetary exploration may add more lower torso injuries due to ambulation. Therefore its important to design better fitted and more comfortable spacesuits to reduce EVA injury risk

 

Chapter 2: Background

·     So overall I feel several of the paragraphs in this section have the same issue as the prior chapter, namely that it’s not clear what the arguments are from section to section. It’s a nice thorough review, but please review all topic sentences and closing sentences to ensure the material builds to your intended point. --hopefully the 2nd draft now reflects this

·     “much more walking” Yes – but also the Apollo astronauts loped. Maybe to get around this we say “ambulation”? Or “traversing”? --changed to ambulation throughout chapter

·     “Higher incidence rate” add the “than” – microgravity, than the EMU, than whatever you think is the most appropriate one to throw in --removed and moved to summarize motivation

·     Next sentence is awkward “While these specific injury…” --removed

·     Mobility features – not only to maintain constant volume but also because they create points at which the suit can buckle more easily (this is from thin wall pressure vessel models) -added

·     2nd paragraph “mobility design features” needs a topic sentence --added

·     More context on Z2 – developed by whom and when and why? --added

·     “Subjects still reported..” Clarify by saying “In fit checks” Or “design performance testing” etc.

·     2.3 is “Spacesuit mobility” sufficient? What about “Planetary Spacesuit Mobility”? --now specifically MK III Ambulation Performance

·     The difference between spacesuit mobility and spacesuit ambulation is ambiguous . While different, they do not seem like the need to be separate sections. For example section 2.3.1 could easily go in the ambulation section --reorganized to have planetary walking first, then gas pressurized spacesuit characteristics, then MK III ambulation performance

·     2 periods right after “gravity levels” --fixed

·     There seems to be too many subheadings – 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 could all be combined into a section discussing performance --I moved the first paragraph to planetary ambulation, and now I think these subheadings (Now moved up a level) make sense with this new section on MK III Ambulation Performance

·     2.4 – do you want to add your figure here that shows indexing, fit, and pressure leading to injury? --think this makes more sense in the motivation where I introduce these factors? Added to the hypothesized injury mechanisms section. I also changed fit to sizing, because I am referring to fit as both sizing and indexing to be consistent with previous publications

·     Typo “movethe” --fixed

·     Figure 2.1 is way too large – I think this is a formatting error; same for 2.2 --should be better now, but still not ideal in terms of figure size. Will play with Latex some more to get the figures to be appropriately sized
