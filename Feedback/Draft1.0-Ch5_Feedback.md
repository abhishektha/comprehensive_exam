 CHP 5

- The introductory paragraph does not tie this chapter to the rest of the research. You need a new paragraph to clearly delineate how this fits into the context of the research objective, then can go into the background
  - added some new sentences to first paragraph and showed how similar problems exist both in terrestrial and spacesuit footwear
- The chapter itself focuses on footwear and feet generically, and does not relate your findings to the spacesuit boot. This may be fine since you do this in later chapters, but you must frame it appropriately so it’s clear to the reader why this is here and important for your research objective. 
  - agreed, should be better now
- For the SSMs, you should clarify how NASA has used SSMs in other efforts, to further motivate their utility for space applications
  - added
- You have the same issues in this chapter with your objectives formatting – The 2nd to last paragraph of Page 44
  - fixed
- Section 5.2 – references are broken
  - section now removed for brevity
- *For all the following feedback, I removed the DynaMo section and summarized it into two paragraphs. I think this should address the concerns with the abrupt introduction and it should now flow better to the actual study*
  - “90 frames per second”: Revise these sentences to “90 frames per second and represent a cost-effective solution while maintaining a high degree of compared to other systems.” Also this paragraph seems like it should be combined with the paragraph right before it.
  - You introduce DynaMo in an abrupt way – you have not introduced it to the reader (also spell out the name first, so people see where the abbreviation comes from. Also, not sure why these last two paragraphs are separated. 
  - Delete the sentence “It is currently being used…”
  - The first paragraph in the Methods section introduces DynaMo in the way I had asked for above, but it’s out of order
  - You must always refer to a figure before you have it in the text so as to prime the reader it is coming. Figure 5.1 is unclear and needs further explanation. What is on the top row vs. bottom row. You don’t state that this is a foot. It’s not clear why there are spots, etc.
  - As in Chp. 4, you use program names like “Device_manager” which will not be familiar to the readers and should not be written out this way unless you introduce it (as you did DyanMo). Instead you could say “a script to communicate with each camera (XYZ library script “device_manager”).” Or something like that each time.  This is done several times in this chapter and they should all be revised in this manner.
    - removed
  - The transition between 5.2 and 5.3 is abrupt. I would add a conclusion sentence to the last paragraph of the 5.2 section
  - You change the way you type “DynaMo” in this section. Please be consistent throughout
    - fixed
- Maybe figure 5.2 should go with section 5.2? Since this is where you discuss the checkerboard
  - moved
- 5.3.1.3 should not be a subheading either. More text describing the overall process should accompany this figure to prime the reader for each of the upcoming subsections
  - removed and reintegrated with the summary of data processing 
- “From the provided foot template” I did not see you describe the foot template - Did I miss? We need to clarify and give credit to Matt
  - I missed it when transferring over from the paper. Matt reed's foot publication now referenced
- 5.3.1.6 – Maybe for this aerospace audience we want a diagram of the foot showing exactly where these landmarks are? Oh! You have this but the placement makes it awkward. Also, if you refer to the figure earlier (rather than at the end) then the reader will know to cross reference the figure while reading and not get lost
  - So I think maybe the foot diagram from SA3, where I show the angles would make more sense? I removed the whole section detailing the specifics on how everything was calculated for brevity
- Can you provide standard deviation of scan numbers with the mean, and clarify why there is a subject-specific range
  - done, subject-specific range due to inter-individual differences in stride length
- Typo on “et al” by missing a period. Also check for periods on the figure captions.
  - fixed
- “See supplemental figures” – what is this referring to? I did not see supplemental figures in the document and you should also clarify, if you do have this, which ones specifically they should be looking for
  - I removed the reference to supplemental figures, I don't think its highly necessary for the comps document to have that? 
- Please check all your links – fig:coefs
  - fixed
- Again, the discussion here focuses on footwear, but not on spacesuit boots. Need to relate this back to how it contributes to fixing heel off
  - redid the last paragraph in discussion to focus specifically on heel-lift; design goals of capturing the midfoot (due to midfoot girth decrease) and designing a better heel counter (due to rearfoot morphology changes) 
- 5.4 “This exact change in measurement was not taken in this study”. What do you mean by this? You mean for the static feet this linear measurement was not recorded? Also need to clarify why an in-depth sizing analysis is important for this application! 
  - We didn't record the static measurement (since its not a usual foot measurement to record), but I meant that we only captured shape changes and not measurement changes with the model; now clarified 
- “Volumental’s database” you have not introduced this database or described it, so it’s not clear what is going on with this collaboration and how it will help solve a problem we have identified with your analysis alone
  - Introduced and tied it into the heel-lift problem again
- “If desired” maybe change this language to say “As a thesis reach goal” or something to that effect. Need to also clarify what these reach analyses would contribute to your specific research objectives in addition to what you have stated as a more general science contribution.	
  - clarified to say that this is more of a science/engineering contribution rather than a thesis contribution
