Feedback 1:

- 15 apollo missions? Not all of those were surface missions so that’s misleading
  - fixed to 6 apollo missions (only surface)
- I like how in this intro you’ve focused on planetary but successfully integrated EMU-based data
- Slide 7 “These are examples” maybe say “these are examples of lower body injuries”
  - added to caption
- Slide 8 – your explanation here could have been smoother
- Transition from motivation to background – emphasize that for the background  you’re also focused on planetary surface exploration issues
  - added to subtitle
- The pads are not really intended to “fill” the space (other than maybe the  boot?). Rather they are more geared toward providing and additional  comfort layer
  - I think I'll say they're for comfort and indexing 
- Body – shape model slide – nice. Well motivated
- Gaps – nice to summarize
- I think the way you motivate and build your presentation is very clear
- We’re at about 13-14 mins in when you start Aim 1.
- Slide 23 – I think you may want to work on this part. It’s not super clear  from the figures what you’re doing and how. I think one of the things is that most of the audience will not be familiar with the challenges… so maybe spend some more time in the set up? For example, you explained zero  velocity and zero position on slide 25, but had already referred to it  before
  - I think adding the background slide to this aim will help with this a lot
- Overall, I think you spent an appropriate amount of time on this. I was worried  you were getting into the weeds, but then you transitioned to the  results, but I think this is ok. 
- Slide 26 – So these results are not those I am used to seeing. Did you screen the data to throw out values? Maybe I’m misremembering. I also don’t’  think you talked through the violin plots sufficiently. The text is difficult to read in the figure, and it’s not clear that you have each of the  different subjects here.
  - same results as always. I made the plot more condensed and text bigger. I will make sure to talk through the plot a bit more
- 27 – I think we want to clarify that this was a negative result in some  ways. I don’t think that came across and I don’t want people to think  we’re overstating what the method can contribute. 
  - I removed our speculations of how anthropometry may affect the results. Also emphasized the negative results in the summary slide
- Aim 2 – Maybe re-emphasize why shape modeling is important while you transition. How does Aim 1 motivate Aim 2?
  - added a background slide , will mention how designing a better fitting boot requires knowledge of foot shape
- Previously you had animated the cameras with a red circle so people could really see them. I think that’s helpful
  - added
- Slide 34 – animate the slide with each step so people can follow and it helps clarify the process. Also add Reed citation here
  - now animated with Reed citation
- Slide 35 – again, take the time to walk people through the figure
  - figure deleted and pushed to back-up slides
- Slide 36 – add some text maybe to highlight the take aways in how the model can be used
  - will add in summary slide
- Slide 37 – maybe add some annotating arrows or something so people can really see where the results can be seen in A, B, C
  - added highlighting ovals
- For Aim 2, aren’t we adding the Volumental research into this aim?
  - now added
- 40 – you did not justify why you chose instep height as the parameter for  fleet sizing. It’s not an obvious choice, so you should make that clear
  - now linked to midfoot shape changes
- 41 – please add references. Also, this is ideal – what are the current  spacesuit ROMs in these same locations? One argument people make is that stiffness for a boot like this is a good thing. Use those data and arguments to  motivate the elements on the boot you want to focus design on
  -  clarified in slides
- 42 – animate by showing the elements that make sense for the shoe elements, then add all the measurement elements
  - now animated
- 43 – Instead of saying “this is our design so far” instead state these are concepts we have been thinking about for ways to accommodate the  modeled data, but we are collaborating with industry and academia experts to  understand…
  - clarified
- 44 – you haven’t clarified what your fabrication or testing protocol will  be, so talking about the interface is confusing. Clarify that you’re not only designing, but you’re fabricating and testing, as will be discussed in  Aim 4. 
  - interface moved to SA4
- 45 – I’m confused why you put the fleet sizing analysis with volumental in this aim and not in the aim before.
  - moved to SA2
- The experimental aim 4 should also be formulated in experimental design  language: what is the IV, hypotheses, DV, etc. Specifically calling it  out in this way will really clarify and explain what you’re going to be doing  here
  - now done in this format
- 50 – do you have a schematic you could make for clarifying the ankle seal  vs. the glovebox seal? I think people may not really comprehend what  you’re proposing to do. Joint torques? How were you hoping to do that?
  - diagrams added
- At 9:43 you finished Aim 4
- 53 – Anticipated contributions, not “contributions”
  - split into current/future contributions
- Your first contribution – you developed a method that shows promise, but it  isn’t a definitive method, so the way you phrase this over states what  was accomplished here
  - rephrased contribution
- Gap for 3’rd contribution – I would even argue no framework to incorporate  dynamic aspects of movement into design – so almost like you’re  understating the contribution as written
  - rephrased contribution
- Timeline – can you get rid o the ”mermaid” at the top?
  - fixed
- Your conclusion was very abrupt! After the gantt chart you should provide one summary slide or at least wrap it up more smoothly
  - added a summary slide bringing it back to planetary exploration
- Young young’s comment on hypothesis! Overall returning is exactly what I was saying about the closing.

Feedback 2:

- I think it's good to go through the details of spacesuit injury, but  then make sure you drill down into why it's important for feet/boot fit
- Slide 12 - were the boots ever custom-fit?
  - no, still using pre-made boot inserts. Gloves are the only thing that are custom fit
- Slide 12 - if we don't know what 5th - 95th percentile means, how are we able to say that they only fit 40th-95th percentile?
  - based on specific measures, will specify when talking through
- Pace is about a minute per slide, which is good. 
- Slide 17 - I think it would be worth mentioning that the boot is also super  important -- you didn't just pick it as an easy option for down-scoping  suit fit, right? 
  - definitely, added!
- Slide 22 - all subjects male too? 
  - added
- Slide 23 - maybe you already defined what the shank is and I missed it? Could be worth pointing out in that slide before this one
  - will mention when I'm introducing
- Slide 26 - I'd make the font bigger on this plot
  - fixed
- Slide 26 - might be worth having a diagram to help explain the negative lag, I'm finding it hard to visualize
  - diagram added
- Slide 31 - don't forget to add the number of subjects
  - added
- Slide 36 - is there any way to make the text on the GUI there bigger? Hard to see what the options say
  - done
- Slide 41 - how does ideal foot mobility correspond to the gait cycle -- are  all these limits reached? And how are these motions related to injury?  What are the most likely places for hyper-extension that you have to  worry about?
  - clarified, especially for ankle
- Slide 43 - by actively reducing the girth of the  midfoot, do you mean a lacing mechanism that tightens and releases  automatically with movement? I can imagine that mechanism getting  filled with dust
  - yes, and good point. Will be something to keep in mind
- Slide 49 - how will the configuration with  boots and feet in the glovebox look? The arm holes are kinda far  apart.. are you planning to do this with the LBNP skirt?
  - figure added
- Slide 53 - I really like how you laid this out, nice. 
- Slide 56 - I like your timeline, can you make the dates more readable?
  - dates now not greyed out
- I think that if you defend in January, you'll have to pay for tuition for the spring semester

Feedback 3:

See my comments for your presentation below. Overall, I think it's  in good shape. The one general comment I have is that it would be  helpful to have some kind of feature to orient the audience for a long  presentation like this, e.g. a navigation bar.

- Slide 19: Hypothesis may need more elaboration - how to test "will mitigate" and  "improve"? Also be sure to go back to the hypothesis at the end.
  - Definitely a question to be answered, will elaborate more in SA4
- Slide 29: Why do you only look at foot shape changes in stance phase?
- this is where the majority of foot changes are, clarified in new background slide
- Slide 35: I think I've pointed this out before, but the x axis on this plot is  misleading. It's not immediately clear that these are histograms and  that the shape of the curves does not relate to the values on the x  axis. 
- violin plots are really common now, but I should mention that these are distributions. Plot moved to back-up slides
- Slide 43: Might help to explain what findings from SA2 motivate each of these changes
- now added in SA2
- Slide 45: How does static scanning to capture in-step height work?
- clarified in new slide
- Slide 49: More detail on how testing of boot in glovebox would work would be  helpful, in particular making clear that you are not intending to test  gait, just range of motion. Also briefly describe the test setup.
  - new figures added for test setup

Feedback 4:

- Aim 1 experimental results: you made a couple claims about  variation in your data from aim 1. Because your N value was 3, can those claims really be made or are they only speculations? Just out of  curiosity, why did you only have 3 subjects for this portion (correct me if I'm wrong, but for human study there isn't a minimum N value 6 for  significance)? 
  - honestly just a limitation on spacesuit testing time. Have a new power-analysis slide in the back-up slides to show that this is actually not too bad 
- You might want to justify why you chose the boot as a proof of concept instead of a glove or shoulder.
  - emphasized boot's importance in gait
- You mention other solutions but never really say if you are going to explore those options (ie sole construction)
  - removed these
- Might need a schematic of the problems with the current design and the  specific aspects of your research that address those challenges
  - I think my new figures throughout SA2 and SA3 help address this
