Comps Feedback Round 2: This draft is great! Some comments below. It must feel nice to be halfway done writing your thesis as well!

 

- Intro page – need period after S for both BS and MS
  - added
- Page 1 blank with a line – on purpose? Maybe to make the chapter 1 start on an odd page for printing?
  - yes, I think this is on purpose with the CU thesis template

 

 

Chapter 1

- Hanging word on pg. 3 at the end of the paragraph
  - fixed
- “Have resulted in a number of crew injuries” maybe say “have increased the incidence rates and severity of crew injuries” Since they also had injuries before the EMU
  - done
- “While the wearer is neutrally buoyant” rephrase to say” While the suit and human together are made neutrally buoyant, the person inside the suit is able to shift relative to the suit due to gravity” or something along these lines
  - done
- Joint centers “drift” out of alignment. I think drift is the wrong word choice here. Right after this I think you’re missing a period after reference 114
  - changed to "suit-operator joint centers become misaligned", added period
- Hanging word on pg. 8 at the end of the page
  - fixed

 

Chapter 2

- Italicize this sentence? Therefore, a gas-pressurized spacesuit's mobility restrictions and joint mechanical work, along with its pressure forces, may also be affecting suited ambulation
  - done
- References 84 and 55 – maybe you want them after eq 2.3 instead of at the start of the line for the text after the actual equation?
  - moved
- Need a space before reference 87?
  - done
- Before 2.3.1 maybe end the paragraph by saying the results of these studies are outlined below for a smoother transition. Although maybe that isn’t strictly true since now as I continue to read you also talk about other studies… I guess the point I am making is that the paragraph needs a closing sentence.
  - Added: These and similar tests provide insight into how the MK III's design factors affect suited ambulatory performance. 
- Reference 87 for Cooper-Harper Scale also needs a space before it. 
  - added
- “walk in” ending in preposition
  - changed to "requires more effort during suited ambulation"
- My thesis is cited for the pressure sensors, but I would suggest our Acta Astronautica paper as well 
  - added
- Page 18 – reference hanging on the line below
  - fixed
- You use the term “operator-spacesuit” interaction, which is a nice phrase. Make sure this is consistently used throughout, though, instead of human-spacesuit or potentially wearer could be replaced by operator as appropriate (although not in all cases would that make sense)
  - changed to operator where its appropriate in the whole document (whenever we're talking about someone in the spacesuit)

 

Chapter 3

- The following gaps were identified from the previous research, as outlined in the literature review presented in the previous two chapters, and will…
  - added
- Limited efforts – weird phrasing
  - changed to "few efforts to quantify"
- Maybe bold your hypothesis or italicize it – something to make it stand out even more
  - bolded
- SA1 – Maybe say for the last sentence “… indicator of heel-lift and identifies a means by which future work directly quantify heel-lift” or something along those lines
  - added "and identifies a methodology directly quantify heel-lift in future work"
- SA 3 – one specific subject is stated, but as per our conversations on SA4 we may want to update this. Say instead this aim will yield a final single-sized prototype or something. The way SA3 is stated it doesn’t incorporate the prototype. Maybe “Define and validate a design process” since the prototype is the validation?
  - took out the sentence on sizing and incorporated the "define and validate" into the title
- One thing for SA4 is that you could say the methods developed in SA1 will also be incorporated – make that more explicit/clear
  - added " Methods from SA1 along with a contact sensor in the heel "
- At the end of this chapter, I would summarize progress on each of the 4 aims or alternatively summarize what remains to be done.
  - added

 

Chapter 4

- Why the “;” in the first sentence?
  - changed to comma
- Missing t in “heel-lift” in last sentence of first paragraph
  - added
- Instead of saying “left in the analysis” what about ‘retained in the analysis”
  - changed
- Pg 32 – the description of the variables is not in line-text form as I would have expected and is consistent with the other equations you have presented earlier in the thesis
  - changed to be in-line
- Table 4.1 does not seem to be centered. I don’t think you’re changing the figure caption text size, so I’m thinking the table caption text size also shouldn’t change.
  - now centered, no idea why it fights with me so much
- Subject naming convention is confusing – Maybe state that you kept the naming convention consistent with the Fineman paper for the ability to cross reference results and state why no Subject 1 
  - added in experimental design section
- Pg 36 – hanging word “points”
  - fixed
- The conclusion here could be expanded upon. Essentially you’re saying the IMUs may not be useful, but that pressure sensors can be integrated to detect. Since you will be doing this in aim 4, flesh this out a bit. Also, I think we want to highlight here that the algorithm you developed while not useful for this particular data set, if augmented with the other data or potentially different IMUs, data collection protocol optimized for assessing this problem, then it WOULD be very useful (actually not sure what other aspects may be improved upon to make the methodology have greater utility)
  - added: "Such techniques can be used to augment the presented heel-off detection for the operator inside the spacesuit. 
    Improvements to IMU mounting on the spacesuit or characterization of the SLL leg lengthening may also decrease the effect of spacesuit pressure forces, and improvements in sensor technology can characterize the spacesuit leg lengthening effect. 
    Contact sensors and pressure insoles will be evaluated for testing in Specific Aim 4. "

 

Chapter 5

- The word gait on its own line is a bit weird. May need to artificially put in a line break
  - added the artificial line break, but then it shows up really weird in the table of contents so I decided to stick with just having the gait on its own line. 
- Aim bullet points on pages 38 and 39 should probably start with a capital letter?
  - changed
- Intro to 5.2 – “This section describes our low-cost 4D scanning system used to capture foot shape during ambulation. Human body shape…” Ah ok I see what you mean when you say you shortened this section! I think that’s great… maybe my intro sentence could be more like “We developed a low-cost 4D scanning system, DynaMo, to…”
  - added "A low-cost 4D scanning system, DynaMo, was developed to capture dynamic foot shape during gait. "
- Here the table 5.1 also has smaller font size for the description- I think as long as you’re consistent it should be ok.
- Space between guidelines and [101]
  - added
- Figure 5.3 – can you make the text bigger? There is a lot of open space that could be used if you expanded the text boxes
  - text size increased by 4pt
- I may have missed it in the methods section, but we do want to call out Matt specifically for the template to acknowledge him
  - I had referenced the publication, but I'll call him out specifically 
- 5.3 ends with limitations, but I think it should really end with the last paragraph of 5.3.3 as a conclusions statement on what we can summarize and take away from these results for spacesuit boots
  - I moved the limitations paragraph above the last paragraph of 5.3.3, and made that last paragraph a conclusions paragraph
- “This analysis will be repeated…” For clarity, say “in this thesis, and in collaboration with Volumental AG, I will extend these results to instep girth and relate those findings to implications for spacesuit boot design”. Clarify exactly why this matters for your problem here by reiterating the take away message from the first paragraph
  - added "In this thesis, and in collaboration with Volumental AB, these results will be extended to instep girth. 
    Findings from this study will be related to spacesuit design variables. ""

 

Chapter 6

- Here your bullet points do all start with a capital letter for the objectives, so I think you should definitely do that in Chapter 5
  - done in chapter 5! 
- Space between joints[55]
  - fixed
- “less flexible, harder, material” Something is funky here. I think it has an extra comma, and less flexible and harder are redundant – not sure what you’re trying to say exactly by including both
  - took out harder since it is redundant
- At the end of this chapter you introduce heel-slip, but you had not introduced that previously. I do think it’s important so I suggest going back to all chapters and identifying where heel-slip should be introduced as a byproduct of heel-lift and ultimately what leads to skin-surface injuries we want to prevent. Mention both as appropriate throughout the thesis. 
  - I meant heel-lift here, we were back-and-forth earlier this year on calling it heel-lift vs heel-slip, and we decided on heel-lift which is what I used throughout the whole document except here
- Pg 66 – space suit instead of spacesuit. Do a search throughout for consistency
  - fixed to spacesuit
- Progress paragraph could also state the progress on the collaborations
  - I'm not sure how to state this more than what we have because there hasn't been too much "concrete" work done. I think it'll depend heavily on what the "chatrettes" we get back from UOP produce

 

Chapter 7

- Can we get a figure for 7.2 to clarify the two testing paradigms?
  - added
- "counts of heel-lift in a standardized trial”
  - added
- Missing a period between mobility and Subjective.
  - added
- Refer back to aim 1 here as I mentioned previously in my feedback
  - added: "Findings from Specific Aim 1 showed that IMUs may not be appropriate for detecting instances of heel-lift. 
    Therefore, a force sensor will be placed in the heel of the boot, in as minimally intrusive position as possible, to detect instances of heel-lift. 
    If possible, a sensor which can measure distance between the sole and heel will be selected for this application. 
    Instances of heel-lift will also be correlated to subjective comments, and future work may use the selected sensor to validate IMU usage in detecting heel-lift in the spacesuit. "
- Also indicate the way in which you will randomize the trails/condition
  - added: "The order in which a subject tests each boot will be counterbalanced to avoid carryover and fatigue effects."  when I introduced the subjects
- Walking will occur on a flat walkway – where do you anticipate doing these tests? That should be stated we don’t currently have the desired hardware in our lab, but our collaborators may. Would this be at BOA? How would we do the pressurization?
  - Added: "These evaluations will also be dependent on access to collaborators' lab facilities with force plates and optical motion capture. 
    The boot will be pressurized through a portable compressor, with a pressure line running to the subject and routed to the boot. "
- The spacesuited testing should be a separate paragraph since it’s another level of testing you would like to aim for
  - made a new paragraph and spelled out the process a bit more

 

Chapter 8

- Showed drawbacks and identified areas of future implementation for how IMUs could be used to detect
  - added
- Table 8.1 and 8.2 – Still awkward vertical spacing between the groups, making it difficult to read
  - added some more spacing between each item

 

References

- My thesis is off the page in your references. Also, I’d suggesting adding my stats paper on shoulder injuries in the intro section where you talk about anthropometry and training/duration as contributing factors to injury. The one where we measure the pressures can also be used as a reference for excessive contact.
  - all added in!
