# Background

Many of the injuries identified in both operational and training environments have been concentrated around the shoulder/HUT interface, since the microgravity EVA environment is dominated by upper-body tasks. 
The transition to planetary missions will require much more walking, and therefore use of the lower torso, than current microgravity missions. 
Therefore, it can be expected that there will be a higher incidence of lower-torso injury in future planetary missions. 
While these specific injury mechanisms may not occur exactly as in the upper-torso, it is important to study and ensure proper human-spacesuit interaction for future high- use lower-torso spacesuit components.
A risk analysis of injury and compromised performance during EVAs showed poor EVA suit design and poor EVA suit fit as two of the main suit design variables leading to risk [@Chappell2017]. 
This chapter introduces the existing knowledge on suit design, presents the current state of suit mobility as it relates to ambulation, and introduces the challenges with fitting spacesuits. 

## Gas Pressurized Spacesuit Characteristics

### An Inherently Stiff Structure

Gas pressurized spacesuits have been used for all EVAs throughout the history of human spaceflight. 
However, gas pressurized suits become stiff and rigid when pressurized, requiring great effort to bend.
The first EVA spacesuit, the Gemini suit, did not include any design features to reduce bending effort [@Thomas2012].
If a gas pressurized suit component is represented as a pressurized cylinder, bending the cylinder along its axis causes a reduction in volume at the bend [@Harris2001]. 
As a result, pressure at the bend will increase, causing resistance to the bending force. 
The force required to change the volume at the bend is presented as:
$$
F = \frac{W}{d} = \frac{\frac{p\pi D^{3}\phi}{8}}{\frac{L\phi}{2}} = \frac{p\pi D^{3}}{4L}
$$
[@Newman1997;@Harris2001], where $F$ is the force required, $W$ is the work required, $d$ is the distance the joint is flexed,  $p$ is the pressure, $D$ is the cylinder's diameter, $\phi$ is the joint deformation angle, and $L$ is the length of the cylinder. 
It can be seen that the force required to bend a pressurized joint is not dependent on the bending angle, but rather the length and diameter of the pressurized section.
Without dedicated mobility features to maintain a constant volume at joints, the forces required to bend representative spacesuit components can be as high as 200 lbs for the waist joint [@Newman1997].

### Mobility Design Features

Mobility features specifically designed to maintain constant volume through joint bending motions are needed to reduce bending resistance and allow for joint flexibility [@Harris2001]. 
These mobility features typically feature some form of bellows or convolutes to maintain constant volume and axial restraints to prevent elongation under pressurization [@Harris2001]. 

The Litton company built and tested spacesuits for EVA use in the 1950s, predating both the US and Russian space programs.
These suits iterated on the use of convolutes by inventing the rolling convolute, annular convolute, and cardonic hard joint [@Harris2001].
While these suits never saw operations on spaceflight, they did prove benefits in mobility over the International Latex Corporation (ILC) designed A7L suits, which were eventually used by US astronauts on the moon. 
The Litton suits were able to match the center of restraint and center of pressure when convolute joints were bent, reducing the bending torque and spring return force of the joint [@Harris2001]. 
Therefore, the suit's operator is able to easily bend the joint and not exert much force to keep the joint bent. 
The A7L suit's convolute joints did not match the center of restraint and center of pressure, requiring operators to exert additional force to both bend the joint and keep it bent [@Harris2001]. 
Such drawbacks of the A7L suit required astronauts to come up with clever workarounds. 
On an Apollo 16 EVA, astronaut John Young found that "by hopping into the air and landing on his feet, the weight of his suit overcame the suitâ€™s internal pressure, so he could get to his knees and pick up rocks without using geological tools" [@Portree1997]. 

Advancements since the Apollo era have brought us improvements in pressurized joint design to increase mobility, including the toroidal mobility joint, dual-axis joint, hard component joints, hybrid hard-component/fabric joints, and improvements to flat-patterened joints [@Harris2001]. 
The Mark III Advanced Space Suit Technology Demonstrator EVA Suit (MK III) is a spacesuit designed by NASA as a planetary spacesuit design testbed [@Kosmo1988].
These advancements have allowed for increased lower-torso mobility as shown in the MK III spacesuit technology demonstrator; operators are easily able to recover from a fall and kneel in the MK III while these tasks were done with much difficulty in the A7L and EMU spacesuits [@Kosmo1998].

Lessons from EMU and MK III design have been applied to new planetary Z2 spacesuit. Subjects found mobility improvements for the upper torso to have improved with the Z2 spacesuit [@Meginnis2018]. 
The Z2 spacesuit features a larger scye opening and more mobile shoulder bearings to help with mobility [@Graziosi2016]. 
However, subjects still reported fit issues, and similar muscle fatigue and exertion ratings between the EMU and Z2 [@Meginnis2018].
Limitations with the fit and mobility of the spacesuit still pose a risk for injury. 

## Planetary Ambulation 
Astronauts during the Apollo missions famously did not ambulate in a typical walking fashion; they famously loped across the surface. 
In fact, loping is the energetically preferred gait on the Lunar surface, while walking, skipping, and running are energetically preferable on Mars [@Ackermann2012b].
As speeds increase in lunar gravity, a transition occurs from walking to skipping rather than from walking to running as on Earth [@Minetti2012].
However, the energetically preferred speed is not always achievable or possible, especially when performing EVA tasks, and slow walking speeds may be necessary. 

Walking is modeled as an inverted pendulum which conserves some energy between each step; but energy is not conserved at faster walking speeds and needs muscular power input [@Cavagna1976;@Cavagna1977].
Griffin et al [@Griffin1999] found as gravity is reduced, the amount of mechanical energy conserved between each step is reduced, and the maximum energy recovery occurs at slower speeds. 
Ivanenko et al [@Ivanenko2002] found that muscle activation and ground contact forces decreased with lower gravity levels, but kinematic coordination of the lower limbs were not affected by gravity levels. 

Studying the walk-run or walk-skip transition gives further insight into ambulation on a planetary surface. 
The Froude number is the ratio between the centripetal and gravitational forces in the inverted pendulum model :
$$
Fr=\frac{v^{2}}{gL}
$$
Where $Fr$ is the Froude number, $v$ is the velocity of ambulation, $g$ is the gravitational force, and $L$ is the leg-length [@Alexander1989].
At some critical value,  walking is impossible as the gravitational force cannot match the required centripetal force, which is where the walk-run transition occurs ($Fr*$). 
Humans typically switch to running at $Fr=0.5$.
Kram et al [@Kram1997] offloaded subjects by their waist as they walked and ran on a treadmill, and found that  $Fr*$ increases at lower gravity levels.
The increase in $Fr*$ was hypothesized to be from the arms and legs not being offloaded and still under the influence of gravity [@Kram1997]. 
Donelan and Kram [@Donelan2000] also found that elastic forces were unable to predict the dynamics of reduced-gravity running. 
This suggests that other factors may be at play with walking in reduced gravity. 

Newman and Alexander [@Newman1993] suggested that energy may be expended at low speeds and lower gravity levels for stability and postural control for ambulation. 
Chappell [@Chappell2006] found that when the offload system was set to lock waist rotation for stability, subject's gait was constrained and showed changes in braking and propulsion force for Lunar gravity. 
Therefore, stability is an important factor in walking at lower gravity levels.  

## Spacesuit Mobility

### Modeling Spacesuit Effects on Mobility

Carr and McGee [@Carr2009] developed the Apollo number $Ap$ to explain the effects of spacesuit on gait:
$$
Ap = \frac{Fr}{M}
$$
where $M$ is the mass ratio of the spacesuit. 
$M$ encorporates the self-supported weieght of the spacesuit. 
The self-supported weight of the spacesuit is from the spacesuits pressurization. 
Carr and McGee validated the Apollo number against gait events during Apollo missions, but found that the Apollo number did not fully explain the walk-skip transitions. 
Therefore, spacesuit's mobility restrictions and joint mechanical work may also be affecting the walk-run transition. 


### MK III Ambulation Cost of Transport Factors
Due to the Z2's relative novelty, most spacesuit ambulation studies have been conducted with the MK III spacesuit.
In the EVA Walkback Test (EWT), six male subjects were tested with the MK III spacesuit on a treadmill to explore the effects of the MK III spacesuit's weight on planetary walking in Lunar (1/6g) and Martian (3/8g) gravity levels..
Subjects were tested in three conditions: unsuited and offloaded to selected gravity level; unsuited and offloaded to selected gravity level with the suit weight matched; and suited while offloaded to selected gravity level[@Norcross2009].
This allowed for analyis of suit weight separately from other suit design factors on the metabolic cost of suited walking.
Subjects were tested at three speeds above and three speeds below their walk-run transition speed.
All subjects also did a 1G baseline unsuited trial and a 10 km suited lunar ambulation.
A follow-on integrated suit test (IST) examined the effects of  varied suit mass, gravity, and on metabolic cost and kinematics on Lunar suited gait [@Norcross2010] with similar conditions while varying suit pressure and mass. 

Metabolic cost of transport,  a measure of how much energy the body is exerting during ambulation calculated through direct calorimetry [@Kenny2017], was collected for a variety of conditions.
Metabolic cost is a direct measure of how hard the body is working to move in the spacesuit.
Previous studies have shown that the metabolic cost of transport decreases with gravity [@Grabowski2005]. 

Findings from the EWT and IST were consistent with these previous findings [@Norcross2009;@Norcross2010].
Unsuited weight-matched metabolic costs were lower than 1G unsuited across all speeds for 1/8G ambulation and similar to 1G unsuited for 3/8G ambulation [@Norcross2009].
This suggests that without suit effects, walking on Mars may be metabolically similar to walking on Earth. 
However, the MK III increased the metabolic cost of transport for both gravity environments compared to the unsuited weight-matched condition [@Norcross2009].
At 1/6G, the MK III had a higher metabolic cost than Earth ambulation at lower speeds, but was less metabolically costly at higher speeds [@Norcross2009;@Norcross2010].
The MK III was very metabolically costly in 3/8G, metabolic cost quickly approach maximal values for low speeds and subjects were unable to run in the suit at higher speeds [@Norcross2009].
The metabolic cost of weight (5%-13%) for both Lunar and Martian gravity levels was significantly dwarfed by the cost of suit design factors (87%-95%) [@Norcross2009].
From these results, its apparent that the MK III cannot service ambulation Mars due to its design factors, but may be sufficient for the Moon. 

The IST found increased suit pressure to minimally increase metabolic cost across all speeds, hypothesized to be due to the constant volume joints of the MK III [@Norcross2010].
However, there were some subjective differences in mobility noted across the different pressures, although there was no correlation to subject anthropometry [@Norcross2010].
The effect of suit weight, which encompasses gravity level and suit mass, steadily increased with speed [@Norcross2010].
The percentage of metabolic cost that was not explained by suit weight or pressure decreased as speed increased, but then increased at the fastest speed [@Norcross2010].
These factors can include suit kinematics, stability, and harnessing effects from the gravity offloading, which may be causing more difficulty for ambulation at lower speeds. 
The majority of ambulation during an EVA is most likely done at lower speeds, thereby requiring further understanding of how suit design is affecting mobility at low speeds. 

### MK III Ambulation Effect on Walking Biomechanics
The IST captured little differences in kinematics as a function of pressure, which may be due to the constant volume joints [@Norcross2010].
However, it was noted that at 4.3 psi, the knee joint was limited by the design of the pressurized suit, and that the ankle increased its range-of-motion (ROM) to compensate the limited knee ROM [@Norcross2010].
This shows the importance of the kinematic chain in suited mobility; when a certain motion is inhibited, other joints along the kinematic chain will have to compensate. 
Similar compensation has led rotator cuff injury in the EMU's HUT [@Williams2003]. 

Cullinane et al [@Cullinane2017a] found suited MK III ambulation at 1G to reduce heel and toe clearance above ground compared to unsuited walking. 
In addition, the MK III was found to decrease speed, stride length, and step length compared to unsuited walking [@Cullinane2017a].
Cadence and stance time increased with gravity level in the IST, consistent with how metabolic cost increases with gravity level [@Norcross2010].
These findings suggest that the MK III inhibits operator mobility and agility when walking. 

### Subjective Feedback on MK III Ambulation

Subjective feedback allows operators of the MK III to provide their perception of walking in the suit. 
Rating of Percieved Exertion (RPE) and Gravity Compensation and Performance Scale (GCPS) were consistent with metabolic cost findings in both the IST and EWT; both increased with gravity and speed [@Norcross2009; @Norcross2010].
Subjects performing the 10 km walkback in the EWT reported "fair" to "moderate" operator compensation required to walk in the MK III on the Cooper-Harper Scale[@Norcross2009].
While mean rating of discomfort was "very low" to "low" on the Corlett-Bishop Scale, discomfort and trauma were noted on the knees and feet of some subjects [@Norcross2009] [@fig:B-Trauma]. 
In addition, muscular fatigue and tightness was also reported in the quadriceps, thighs, glutes, and lower back [@Norcross2009].

Subjective feedback for walking in the MK III at 1/6-g suggests that it is mostly acceptable.
However, the reported trauma and musculoskeletal discomfort are areas of concern. 
The EWT and IST, along with findings from Cullinane, show that the MK III's design inhibits natural human motion and requires more effort to walk in. 
However, it is not enough to make a suit that is more mobile; it also needs to work closely with its operator.

## Spacesuit Fit

Human-spacesuit interaction is driven by how well the spacesuit fits around its operator. 
Contact and musculoskeletal injuries stem from inadequate static and dynamic fit between the spacesuit to the human.
Static fit refers to the alignment between the operator and the spacesuit, while dynamic fit refers to the coordination of the operator to the spacesuit during motions [@Stirling2020]. 
Poor static fit leads to empty space around the operator, which allows the operator to move inside and repeatedly contact the spacesuit. 
However, improving static fit is not as easy as filling this empty space; this would hamper operator mobility and lead to poor dynamic fit and difficulty for the operator to move the suit. 
Poor spacesuit-operator fit is a factor of both difficulty in sizing the suit to the crewmember,  ensuring that suit movements match desired human movements, and understanding human body shape. 

### Spacesuit Sizing and Fit Process

The Apollo EVA spacesuits were custom tailored for each individual, a feat achievable with the small number of astronauts needing EVA suits [@Harris2001].
However, with a larger and more diverse astronaut corp, custom suits became infeasible. 
Currently, only the EMU glove is custom made if one which fits the astronaut does not exist [@Chappell2017].

NASA STD-3000 calls for spaceflight hardware to accommodate an anthropometric range from the 5th-percentile female to the 95th-percentile male [@NASA1995]. 
The EMU suit was designed to target this range with modular and adjustable components. 
Table XX shows the number of modular component available for the EMU [@King1982].
However, the EMU design only ended up fitting a 40th-percentile female to a 95th-percentile male [@Kim2019].
Current suit fit processes do not use any objective measures to define proper fit; a baseline fit is prescribed from anthropometric measures and then iterated through subjective feedback [@Fineman2017].

Sizing rings are used in the EMU design to change the length of components like arms and legs [@Harris2001].
Sizing inserts such as pads can also help position the operator within the spacesuit [@Chappell2017].
The length of restraint straps at convolute joints can be adjusted to change the length of soft components, but this affects joint mobility as the length-diameter ratio is modified [@Harris2001]. 

### Human Body Characterization for Fit Checks

NASA's Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) has focused on characterizing the human body as it relates to spacesuit fit. 
Linear measurements are traditionally used in sizing algorithms to determine a baseline suit fit. 
These linear measurements are then compared to linear measurements in the suit's design to determine appropriate sizing components. 
However, linear measurements do not always accurately represent a person's body shape [@Margerum2010].
Three-dimensional scanning can help accurately characterize body-shape to allow for virtual fit testing against 3D models of the suit. 
Boundary manikins can be generated which represent the extremities of accommodated anthropometry, and overlaid on 3D suit models to determine fit [@Margerum2010].
Virtual fit check metrics may include penetration depth, contact areas, and overlap volume [@Kim2019]. 
Monte-Carlo simulations of vast databases can also be virtually tested to find fit problems that may occur outside the boundary manikins [@Kim2019].

It is well known that parts of the body change shape during movement. 
Capturing 3D-scans in multiple poses also allows for the development of a parametric models that can estimate how body shape changes with a specific movement; for example this can be used to check shoulder clearance around the HUT [@Kim2016].
This can greatly improve dynamic fit as it ensures the HUT accommodates the shoulder throughout its entire motion. 
However, this methodology is limited to poses where the subject can pause between motions due to technological limitations for capturing dynamic body shape changes. 

Body shape changes can also occur from exposure to an altered-gravity environment. 
The ABF found on average posture to increase by a maximum of 3%, hip circumference to decrease by a mean of 7%, and thigh circumference to decrease by a mean of 10% during microgravity spaceflight [@Kim2019]. 
EMU sizing incorporates a 2.54cm increase in torso length to accommodate this change [@Thornton1987]. 

Information from virtual fit testing can be incorporated into spacesuit design by informing where the internal geometry may need to be expanded or contracted to better fit the target population [@Kim2019]. 
This process was used to validate the design of the Z2 suit. 
However, it is virtually impossible to incorporate personal preferences of fit into this process; currently a threshold is implemented to determine acceptable levels of ease or compression [@Kim2019].
In addition, modifying design to accommodate findings from fit can only be done to a certain extent; there are limitations on modifying the structure of an existing design while still meeting the same engineering requirements. 
There are also no clear metrics for translating virtual fit testing into spacesuit component design. 
Therefore, fit will still need to be validated with the target population before being acceptable. 


### Quantifying Fit
Quantifying fit relies on measuring human motion inside the spacesuit, which is difficult as traditional-motion capture techniques do not work. 
Pressure sensors can help quantify contact between the operator and spacesuit [@Anderson2014].
Inertial-measurement unit systems aim to provide some insight into in-suit motion [@Bertrand2016, @Shen2019].
Fabric strain sensors have also been developed to predict body-shape inside the spacesuit [@Kim2019]. 

Fineman et al. [@Fineman2018] introduced two objective fit metrics: difference in knee angle ROM between the suit and operator, and the relative coordination metric [@Fineman2017a]. 
The relative coordination metric allows for the identification of whether the suit or the operator is driving the other component. 
However, both of these metrics require measuring human movement inside the spacesuit.

### Effects of Fit on Performance
The effect of fit on performance needs to be quantified to properly implement and understand objective fit metrics. 
The ABF found that a back pad could improve controllability of the EMU's upper body [@Chappell2017].

Fineman et al. [@Fineman2018] studied the effects of fit on MK III ambulation using objective fit metrics. 
Three subjects walked in a spacesuit with different levels of padding, meant to mimic three different levels of fit.
Two subjects had reduced knee ROM compared to unsuited ambulation. 
One subject had no significant differences in metrics between padding levels but reported better responsiveness with higher levels of padding.
Another subject had the lowest knee ROM with no padding, aligning with their feedback that higher levels of padding are harder to control.
Suit fit engineers have commonly reported a dynamic fit problem where the heel lifts out of the boot during heel-off, which was also reported by one subject in the study [@Fineman2018].
[@fig:B-HeelLift] shows how heel-lift can occur through poor fit and indexing. Data collected from Fineman's study shows that during heel-off, the suit appears to be driven by the wearer at the calf, which could be an indication of heel-lift. Fineman et al [@Fineman2018] suggests that boot fit may be very important to walking in the MK III, and that the objective fit metrics presented are sensitive to small changes in fit. 

![Heel-lift occurring during heel-off, as subjectively reported in the MK III. The poor fit and indexing in the boot and lower torso allows the heel to lift inside the boot during heel-off](../fig/Background/HeelLift.png){#fig:B-HeelLift}

## Summary

Walking on another surface and gravitational environment presents many challenges of its own, including changes in preferred gait patterns. 
Wearing a stiff, pressurized spacesuit further increases the effort required to walk.
While constant volume joints may reduce  pressurization effects, unquantified factors such as joint torques and poor operator-spacesuit interaction may also be leading to injury.

Fitting a diverse range of persons to the spacesuit also faces challenges including limited suit sizing components, limited suit design flexibility, an incomplete understanding of body shape changes, and lack of objective fit metrics to validate fit. 
Poor fit has the ability to reduce performance in the spacesuit by affecting how the operator moves the suit.  Ambulation specific fit issues, such as heel-lift, have been subjectively identified in the MK III but not fully quantified. 
While there has not been a large scale study on injuries in the MK III, these fit issues may lead to injury in similar mechanisms as noted in the EMU.
