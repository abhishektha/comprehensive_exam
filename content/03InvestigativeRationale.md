# Investigative Rationale

Matched fit and mobility must be ensured by suit design to ensure safe, comfortable planetary ambulation. 
Ideally, the spacesuit should require minimal additional exertion or change in movement strategies to ambulate compared to ambulating on Earth. 
To achieve this, spacesuit components should be the shape of the operator's body throughout their entire motions. 
Currently, spacesuit mobility is designed around the achieveble mobility range first, and then fit to the operator's body type second. 
Dynamic body-shape models provide insight into how the body changes shape through  moves and changes shape, have the ability to improve compatibility between the spacesuit and operator, and provide better static and dynamic fit, but have only been used in a limited fashion with the Z2 shoulder design.
No clear process exists for integrating dynamic body-shape models into the spacesuit design process. 

This proposed thesis will investigate the applicability of body shape models to improve fit and comfort for planetary EVA suit design. 
To limit the scope of the work, the proposed work will focus on fit and mobility of the spacesuit boot.
The MK III spacesuit currently uses a pressurized modified hiking boot with a convoluted ankle joint and boot sizing inserts.
The boot is an important component for MK III ambulation and MK III boot fit has been identified as a key issue in suit fit [@Fineman2018].
While the thesis will focus on the foot-boot interface design, the novel contribution lies in the development of a experimental and design framework to translate body-shape changes into spacesuit design variables.
The proposed hypothesis of this work is therefore:

> Integrating dynamic body shape changes into the spacesuit boot design process will mitigate factors that lead to injury and improve compatibility between the operator and the spacesuit. 

The proposed thesis will encompass the following specific aims:

- Specific Aim 1: Quantify heel-lift in spacesuit gait 
    - Motivation: Heel-lift was subjectively reported as a potential symptom of poor fit during gait in the MK III, but was never quantified. Quantifying the level of heel-lift may lead to heel-lift can better inform boot design to mitigate this issue. 
    - Summary of Work: Walking data was collected on the MK III by Fineman et al. [2018]. This data was reanalyzed in the context of boot fit by analyzing vertical accelerations of the spacesuit's lower leg and operator's tibia. Heel-off times were detected using vertical accelerations. An analysis was conducted on quantifying displacement from vertical accelerations, but was found to have large margins of error. Therefore, this work proposes differences in heel-off times as an indicator of heel-lift. 

- Specific Aim 2: Predictively model dynamic changes in foot morphology during gait with statistical shape modeling
    - Motivation: The foot changes shape during the loading process of stance phase. Modeling these changes as they relate to subject anthropometry and kinematics will allow for prediction of dynamic foot shape during stance phase. 
    - Summary of Work: A novel dynamic foot scanning system was developed to capture 4D foot scans from subjects walking on a treadmill. Dynamic foot scans were captured from thirty subjects as they walked on the treadmill. A predictive statistical shape model was developed to predict dynamic foot shape with an accuracy of 5.2 mm. From the model, the midfoot was found to decrease in girth as the foot is lifted through heel-off.

- Specific Aim 3: Develop a design methodology to integrate shape modeling into planetary spacesuit boot design
    - Motivation: Existing knowledge on foot mobility can provide mobility requirements for a planetary spacesuit boot. Insight from the dynamic foot shape model can be integrated with these mobility requirements to develop a boot design that accommodates the mobility and dynamic shape of the boot. 
    - Summary of Work: Mobility of the foot was characterized from the existing literature. A biomechanical design framework was developed to integrate these mobility requirements with the dynamic foot shape model developed in Specific Aim 2. This framework will be used to create a pressurized planetary spacesuit boot prototype. The framework will also incorporate a larger sizing study that takes into account population instep height. The prototype boot will be constructed and sized for one specific subject. 

- Specific Aim 4: Evaluate a prototype planetary spacesuit boot design for fit and comfort
    - Motivation: The planetary spacesuit boot design developed in Specific Aim 3 will be tested for improved fit and comfort as compared to a current MK III spacesuit boot design and a non-pressurized standard hiking boot. This will directly test the hypothesis of this thesis. 
    - Summary of Work:  The test subject will perform ROM tests in a glovebox with a vacuum, which will pressurize the boot. The subject will also perform heel lifts against a false floor simulate the heel-off phase of gait. Kinematics of the ankle and MTP joint will be captured. A contact sensor in the heel of the footwear will check for the heel-lift. Subjective surveys will assess the subject's fit and comfort levels. If the prototype boot design can achieve pressurization around the foot outside the glovebox, gait kinetics and kinematics will be captured with all three designs. The prototype boot may also be tested in conjunction with a full spacesuit, pending spacesuit testing availability.
