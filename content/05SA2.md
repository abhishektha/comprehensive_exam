# Specific Aim 2: Predictively modeling dynamic changes in foot morphology during gait

## Introduction

Foot shape is known to be highly variable throughout the population, including by sex [@Wunderlich2001; @Krauss2008; @Krauss2010], age [@Tomassoni2014], and weight [@Price2016]. 
This variability is often not captured in footwear sizing, as current footwear fitting standards only use foot length, foot width, and arch length to fit to standardized shoe sizes [@ASTM2017].
Furthermore, footwear is commonly designed around lasts, shoe molds that are sized and shaped by each manufacturer with no common standard, leading to variability in footwear shapes and sizes [@Jurca2013; @Wannop2019]. 
Such variability can make it hard for consumers to find a proper fit, resulting in users having to wear ill-fitting footwear with suboptimal comfort [@Dobson2018b]. 
Footwear comfort has shown benefits in increasing running performance [@Luo2009] and reducing the risk of movement-related injury [@Mundermann2001a], and is often the number one [@Martinez-Martinez2017] factor for consumers to select footwear. 
Footwear should therefore be properly fit to a wide population range in order to be successful. 

However, because the current methodology of designing footwear relies on using static lasts, this assumes that the foot consists of rigid segments.
This fails to account for dynamic changes in foot morphology, especially when the foot is being loaded during gait. 
Assumptions of rigid foot segments during foot loading have shown inaccuracies in estimation of ankle joint mechanics [@Zelik2018; @Kessler2020], suggesting intra-foot motion as the foot is loaded [@Lundgren2008; @Wolf2008]. 
Evidence suggests that foot loading affects linear foot measurements, such as when transitioning from sitting to standing [@Xiong2009; @Oladipo2008] or during the stance phase of gait [@Kouchi2009; @Barisch-Fritz2014; @Grau2018].
The dynamically changing measurements suggest morphological changes occurring, all of which may not be captured in static linear and circumferential measurements. 
Thus, it becomes difficult to characterize the wide variety of foot shapes across not only a large population, but within individuals as their foot goes through loading scenarios such as gait. 

Statistical shape models (SSMs) can explain morphological differences across populations by identifying shape modes which account for variance from the mean foot,. 
These have been developed for whole-body digital human modeling applications to study population and individual variance in body shape [@Allen2003; @Anguelov2005; @Reed2014; @Park2015a; @Park2017]. 
Parametric SSMs are extensions which use correlations between subject anthropometric data and SSM deformations to help predict body shape for new individuals in the population [@Park2015a; @Park2017]. 

SSMs have recently been applied to characterize static foot shape across a population [@Conrad2019] and recognize foot-shape deviations [@Stankovic2020].
The aforementioned efforts to capture foot measurement changes over the gait cycle did capture 4D foot images [@Barisch-Fritz2014;@Grau2018], but these efforts were not translated into a SSM. 
All the previously developed systems were also based on a catwalk, requiring subjects to correctly hit the scanning area for a successful data capture, which may not be representative of natural cadence. However, the systems used to capture 4D foot shape are very expensive and cannot be used around a treadmill, which allows for subjects to fall into natural gait. No SSMs have been developed to predict dynamic foot shape from previous capture of 4D foot scans. 

Therefore, the objectives of this specific aim are:
- develop a low-cost 4D scanning system capable of capturing foot shape around a treadmill
-  create a predictive model of foot shape changes across the dorsal surface during stance phase
-  identify specific areas of the foot that change shape during stance phase 
-  correlate changes in foot shape across large-scale population foot measurements

This chapter is split into two sections, the first outlining development of the 4D scanning system, and the second detailing construction and analysis of the model. 

## DynaMo: Dynamic Body Shape Capture with Intel RealSense Cameras

### Background 

Human body shape can be captured with a variety of methodologies, including laser lines, structured light, photogrammetry, and millimeter waves [@Daanen:2013].
However, these technologies require expensive modules and have limited ability to capture dynamic changes in body shape. 

Motion capture with specific markers is commonly done through camera-based motion tracking [@Windolf:2008]
These systems for marker tracking are often cost prohibitive and unable to capture surface morphology.

Recently, Intel released the D415 and D435 RealSense Depth Cameras, which use near-infrared structured light patterns and two infrared imagers to capture depth information at up to 90 frames per second.
Purchasing a set of these cameras is more affordable than buying a dedicated motion-capture system for shape or marker tracking.

While Intel provides the [``librealsense``](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)  library to interface with their cameras, it lacks tools to use multiple devices at once to capture shape and marker-tracking information.
``DynaMo`` builds upon [``librealsense``](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) to provide additional capability for researchers looking to capture such data.

``DynaMo`` is designed to primarily assist those in the biomechanics and medical fields in capturing motion or body-shape data. 
It is currently being used in the Anderson Bioastronautics Research Group to capture dynamic changes in foot morphology. 

![Sample frames collected by DynaMo showing dynamic shape capture](../fig/SA2/sampleFrames.png)

### Methods

``DynaMo`` is a Python library that provides tools to capture dynamic changes in body shape and track locations of markers using Intel RealSense D4XX cameras. 
``DynaMo`` was developed from the examples provided by Intel in the Python [``librealsense``](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) library. It has been successfully tested streaming six cameras at 90 frames per second, all connected to one computer. 
``DynaMo`` consists of several scripts that allow for calibration of multiple RealSense D4XX cameras to a common global coordinate system, simultaneous streaming of multiple RealSense D4XX cameras, viewing of data from multiple RealSense D4XX cameras in pointcloud format, and identification of reflecting markers from the pointclouds.
The library is optimized to reduce the number of dropped frames while streaming.

``DynaMo`` allows for the capture of depth, infrared, and color frames at an $(u \times v)$ resolution from Intel RealSense cameras.
The values that are captured in each frame are listed below:

* Depth frames: $s$, where $s$ is the distance to the object
* Infrared frames: $Y$, where $Y$ is a single value from 0-255 denoting the monochrome pixel value
* Color frames: $[R,G,B]$, where $R,G,B$ are red, green, and blue values, stacked to represent the color value of the pixel. This results in a $(u\times v \times 3)$ dimensional frame.

The pinhole camera model [@Sturm:2014] projects 3D points from the world $[x,y,z]$ onto a 2D image plane $[u,v]$ using the following formula:

$$
s\begin{bmatrix}u\\v\\1\end{bmatrix} = K \times \begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $K$ is a matrix describing the camera's intrinsic properties, and $s$ is the distance between the real-world point and the image plane.
These properties include the focal length ($f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$) and image offset ($pp_{x}$ and $pp_{y}$) in each direction.
They are represented in the matrix as:

$$
K=\begin{bmatrix}f_{x}&0&pp_{x}\\0&f_{y}&pp_{y}\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}
$$

Since we are collecting 2D frames and we want to know the 3D location of the point to reconstruct the pointcloud, we can simply invert the $K$ matrix and solve for the $[x,y,z]$ location as we know $s$, the distance between the 3D point and the 2D plane, and $[u,v]$, the coordinate of the point in the 2D plane:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\dfrac{1}{f_{x}}&0&\dfrac{-pp_{x}}{f_{x}}\\0&\dfrac{1}{f_{y}}&\dfrac{-pp_{y}}{f_{y}}\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}s*u\\s*v\\s\end{bmatrix}
$$

This transformation is known in the computer vision community, and is crucial to the functions present in ``DynaMo``.
``DynaMo`` uses this transformation extensively in its calibration, streaming, and marker-tracking features.

Connected cameras are setup using a ``device_manager`` object which handles calls for communicating with the cameras. 
Cameras are first calibrated to a common global coordinate system by using a defined chessboard viewable by all cameras. 
The chessboard points are detected using the ``findChessboardCorners`` function of the OpenCV library [@opencv_library] for each camera's color image.
Once the chessboard corners are found, they are translated to 3D points from the perspective of each camera and centered.  

The Kabsch algorithm [@Kabsch:1976] is used to compute the $(3\times3)$ rotation matrix between each camera and the known chessboard coordinates.
Translation is calculated by taking the difference between the known chessboard corners and the camera's rotated chessboard perspective, resulting in a $(3\times1)$ matrix.
The rotation matrix is horizontally stacked to the translation matrix, and a row of $[0,0,0,1]$ is added to create a $(4\times4)$ matrix.
This matrix transforms each camera's pointcloud from its local coordinate system to a global coordinate system.

Streaming is achieved by reading frames from each camera into a dictionary object saved in the computer's RAM. 
``DynaMo`` checks frame numbers for continuity to ensure that frames are collected synchronously and are not repeated. 
Once streaming is complete, ``DynaMo`` aligns the images collected by the sensors in each camera to a common image center and saves the images as ``pickle`` objects to the disk. 
The data from all cameras can then be viewed as a single pointcloud for each frame from all cameras by using the previously computed transformation matrix.

## Development of a Predictive Dynamic Foot Shape Model from Statistical Shape Modeling

The development of the DynaMo software [@Boppana2019] for the Intel RealSense D415 Depth Cameras (Intel, Santa Clara CA) allowed a 4D scanning system to be set around a treadmill, where subjects can maintain a natural cadence. 
This system captures the majority of the foot's dorsal surface, but does not allow for the capture of the foot's plantar surface. 
4D scans are captured at 90 fps, enabling a detailed evaluation of foot morphology changes during loading and unloading. 
This section outlines the development of a parametric SSM, derived from scans captured with this system. 
The parametric SSM can characterize and predict dynamic foot morphology at specific points during stance phase across the subject population. 

### Methods

#### Subjects

A total of 30 healthy subjects (15 men and 15 women, ages 23.1 $\pm$ 3.7) participated in this study.
Subjects were recruited in a stratified sample into one of six groups (5 subjects per group) to maximize variance in population foot length. 
Height was used as the grouping factor since height is well correlated to foot length [@Giles1991]. The general population may not know offhand their exact foot length, and shoe size varies by manufacturer and does not correspond directly to foot length [@Jurca2013; @Wannop2019]. Groups consisted of 5th-35th, 35th-65th, and 65th-95th height percentiles for each sex. 
Height percentile values were taken from the ANSUR II survey [@Gordon2014] and converted to imperial units as it was expected most subjects would report their height in imperial units. 
Population recruitment groups are summarized in [@tbl:groups].  

| Sex    | 5th-35th percentile Height | 35th-65th percentile Height | 65th-95th percentile Height |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Female | 4'11"-5'3"                 | 5'3"-5'5"                   | 5'5"-5'8"                   |
| Male   | 5'4"-5'8"                  | 5'8"-5'11"                  | 5'11"-6'2"                  |

: Enrollment groups based on reported height. 5 subjects were enrolled in each group {#tbl:groups}


Prior to recruitment, subjects completed a prescreening survey to ensure they were adequately healthy by the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines[@Riebe2015], and between the ages of 18-65.
Subjects provided their sex and height, and were only enrolled in the study if their population group was not fully enrolled. 

#### Experimental Procedures

The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Review Board.
Procedures were explained to each subject and written consent was obtained prior to participation. 
Subjects’ height and weight were recorded with a tape measure and scale, respectively. 
Subjects’ foot length, foot width, and arch length were measured with a Brannock device (The Brannock Device Company, Liverpool, NY) [@ASTM2017].
Both foot length and arch length were measured in centimeters.
Foot width was measured as an ordinal size (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), and then converted to a linear measurement in centimeters (The Brannock Device Company, Liverpool, NY).

Six Intel RealSense D415 Depth Cameras (Intel, Santa Clara, CA) were placed and calibrated around a custom-built level treadmill in the University of Colorado Boulder Locomotion Laboratory, as shown in [@fig:testSetup].
The DynaMo software package was used to capture depth images of the right foot at 90 frames-per-second while subjects walked on the treadmill, and convert each frame's depth images to a single point cloud [@Boppana2019].

![Capture setup of 6 Intel RealSense D415 Depth Cameras (circled in red) placed around a treadmill. The checkerboard shown was used to calibrate the cameras using the DynaMo package.](../fig/SA2/capturesetup.png){#fig:testSetup }



The treadmill was set to an average walking pace of 1.4 m/s [@Browning2006].
Reflective markers were placed on the subject's right foot and a black sock over their left foot to aid in right foot identification.
Subjects first walked for one minute to warm-up and fall into a natural cadence. 
The operator then collected 10 seconds of data to capture approximately 10 steps.
The data were reviewed to ensure the subject stayed in frame from heel-strike to toe-off during capture. If needed, the subject’s placement was shifted and data was collected again, up to two times.

#### Data Processing

([Fig. @fig:dataflow]) provides an overview of the data processing workflow.

![Flowchart of processing steps for statistical shape model creation](../fig/SA2/footProcessing.png){#fig:dataflow  }



#### Mesh Construction

For each subject, a candidate heel-strike to toe-off event was manually identified across all captures by taking into account point cloud quality due to the high computational power required to process all heel-strike to toe-off events. 
The depth images captured by each depth camera were processed into point clouds using the DynaMo package [@Boppana2019].
The C++ implementation of the PointCloud Library [@Rusu2011] was used to identify and isolate the right foot from the point set. 
First, the point clouds were downsampled with a voxel size of 3 mm to reduce required computing power. 
A RANSAC algorithm [@Fischler1981] was used to identify the flat treadmill floor with a plane model, and remove it from the point cloud. 
Euclidean cluster extraction was then used to detect the point clusters that make up each foot.
The total color value of each point cluster was used to identify the right foot from the left foot, as the left foot had a lower total color value due to the black sock. 
The left foot was then removed from the point cloud, leaving only the right foot for processing. 

Poisson surface reconstruction was done using Open3D [@Zhou2018]; this adds a topological layer interpreted from the pointcloud.
Point normals were calculated for the point cloud using the 10 nearest neighbors. 
A ball-pivoting algorithm [@Bernardini1999] is then used with the point normals to estimate the surface from the point cloud and construct the foot scan mesh. 

#### Foot Template Registration

From the provided template, the toes were smoothed into a single structure and parts of the upper shank removed to be better fit to the captured data, with a finalized structure of 29873 points. 
The overall registration process follows a three-step process: a rough alignment followed by two radial-basis function (RBF) fine alignment steps

The registration process was first completed for each subject's data with a foot scan mesh manually identified near mid-stance. 
A point-to-plane iterative-closest-point (ICP) algorithm [@Chen1992] was used to roughly align the template foot to the scan mesh with the Open3D library [@Zhou2018]. 

Corresponding points between both the scan mesh and the ICP-aligned template were found using a radial-search KD-Tree implemented in the Open3D library [@Zhou2018]. 
Any points on the scan mesh which were not within 1 cm of a corresponding point on the aligned template were deleted; these points represented parts of the treadmill floor which were missed in the RANSAC identification and parts of the upper shank. 
Similarly, any points on the template not within 1cm of a corresponding point on the scan mesh were temporarily set aside from the template; these points correspond to those near holes in the scan mesh which would be refilled in later processing

Thin-plate spline RBFs have been used to surface fit templates to scanned body shapes [@Park2015a], and so were used in two stages in this research. 
A first-pass RBF registration, using a thin-plate spline for interpolation, was done between the template and the scan using the GIAS2 package [@Zhang2016]
To prevent overfitting of the RBF to the noise on the edges of the captured pointcloud, a maximum of five iterations were done on the first-pass RBF registration process. 
The first-pass registered RBF template was then appended with the points previously removed from the template. 
This intermediate template represents the template fitted to the known scan data, with any unknown sections (e.g. holes in the scan data), taking the value of the template. 
However, the disparity between the known and unknown sections created major discrepencies in the morphed template not representative of the scan data. 

A second-pass RBF registration was done from the ICP-aligned template to the intermediate template with the same parameters as the first-pass registration.
This smooths out the unknown sections representing holes in the scan data with the surrounding known sections. 
The second-pass registered template was saved as the final registered template. 

Following the registration of the mid-stance scan, the process was repeated both forwards towards toe-off and backwards toward heel-strike on a scan-by-scan basis.
In this iterative fashion, the previous scan’s registered template was used as the template for the following scan. 
During the iterative registration process, the RBF alignment was only conducted for one iteration for both the first-pass and second-pass to prevent over-fitting.

#### Joint Angle Calculation

The original template identified the lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, 1st metatarsal head, 5th metatarsal head, and 2nd toe landmarks as certain vertices. 
New landmark vertices for the lateral shank and medial shank were manually picked on the template. 

Post-registration scans were aligned to a common coordinate frame based around the toes.
The origin was defined as the point along the vector from the 1st metatarsal head landmark to the 5th metatarsal head landmark which is orthogonal to the second phalange. 
From the origin, the x-axis, was defined as pointing towards the 2nd toe.
The y-axis, was pointed towards the 5th metatarsal. The z-axis was the cross-product of both x- and y-axes, pointed upward. 
This coordinate system also served as the static coordinate system for the MTP joint. 

The ankle joint center was defined as the midpoint between the medial and lateral malleous. 
The ankle's local z-axis is aligned vertically with the shank center, defined as the center between the lateral shank and medial shank landmarks. 
The ankle's local y-axis is aligned from the shank center to the lateral malleolus. 
The ankle's x-axis is the cross-product of the y- and z-axis, pointed in the forward direction towards the toes.

Static reference angles were taken from these coordinate systems at mid-stance. 
For the ankle joint, the z-axis served as the internal/external rotation axis, the y-axis as the dorsi/plantarflexion axis, and the x-axis as the inversion/eversion axis.
Since the model's origin was at the toes, the calculation for MTP dorsi/plantarflexion was modified. 
The new local MTP joint coordinate system had the x-axis defined as pointing from the ankle joint center to the MTP joint center, as such the y-axis represented MTP dorsi/plantarflexion. 
Since there is little flexibility in the transverse and frontal planes of the MTP joint, the x-axis therefore represented whole foot inversion/eversion,  and the z-axis represented whole foot internal/external rotation around the origin. 
MTP and ankle joint angles were calculated for every other scan as the Euler angle difference from the static joint coordinate system around each axis. 
Each subject's joint angles are low-pass filtered with a 2nd order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 15 Hz. 
The global and local coordinate systems are summarized in [@fig:angles].

![Coordinate system defined from registered scans. Anatomical landmarks are shown as black dots.

Directions for each coordinate system are shown in bold text](../fig/SA2/coordsystem.png){#fig:angles  }

#### Model Construction

Principal component (PC) analysis is a dimensionality-reduction method commonly in constructing SSMs [@Reed2008; @Park2015a; @Conrad2019; @Stankovic2020].
The first PC represents an axis containing the largest variance in the dataset, and each subsequent PC describes the largest variance orthogonal to the previous component's axis. 
Therefore, PCs allow for a new, smaller set of orthogonal variables to be defined which represent the variance in the dataset.

Let $N$ equal the number of total scans in the dataset, and $n=29873$ equal the number of vertices in each registered scan. The scikit-learn module [@JMLR:v12:pedregosa11a] was used to incrementally calculate the maximum $N$ PCs which represent the dataset.
Each scan in the dataset is represented in the PC model with $N$ PC scores. 
All PC scores are centered around 0, which represents the mean foot scan of the dataset containing all subjects. 
Each PC represents a shape mode in the SSM, where each score represents a deviation from the mean foot along the shape mode axis. The resultant PC model can be used to inverse transform a vector of length $N$ PC scores into a $29873\times 3$ vector, which represents the location of the vertices in the foot shape. Not all PCs were retained in the model since the first few PCs explain a majority of the variance, while additional PCs may be accounting for noise.

Subject demographic data and calculated joint angles were incorporated into the SSM by developing multivariate linear regression models based on these features. 
This was used to predict each PC score, which can then be inverse-transformed into a foot shape.
Subject demographic data and joint angles were normalized and power-transformed to aid in regression development [@Yeo2000].
An elastic net regularization algorithm [@Zou2005] was run for each multivariate regression to calculate normalized feature coefficients for each PC score's regression. 
Two different sets of predictors were created, one with all subject demographic data and calculated joint angles, and one with the highly cross-correlated predictors of arch length, body-mass index, and height were removed (see Supplementary Figures). 
Six potential models were built as combinations between the number of PCs predicted which explained 95%, 98%, and 99.7% of the variance, and the two predictor sets. 


#### Model Validation

All six models were validated for performance using leave-one-out cross-validation, where scans from each subject were set as the validation set, and models were trained on the remaining dataset. 
Model performance during validation was quantified with the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted foot shape to the corresponding registered scan. 
A two-way RMANOVA analysis was run on the error distributions to test the effect of constructing a predictor with the different number of PCs, and between using the two variable sets. 
The chosen model was retrained on the whole dataset before being analyzed. 

### Results

A total of 1771 scans were analyzed across all 30 subjects. 
Each subject's stance phase ranged from 52-69 scans (mean=59). 
([Fig. @fig:scans]) shows a set of raw and registered scans from one subject.
All processed scans were registered to the template with a median registration accuracy of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.6 mm.

![Processed and registered scans of one subject during heel-off, shown 10 frames (.11 seconds) apart](../fig/SA2/scans.png){#fig:scans  }



The PCA analysis of all registered scans found the first 8 PCs to represent approximately 95% of the variance, the first 27 PCs to represent approximately 98% of the variance, and the first 105 PCs to represent approximately 99.7% of the variance. 
([Fig. @fig:modelperf]) shows the distribution of cross-validation RMSEs for each of the six elastic net regression models tested. 
RMSE distributions did not meet assumptions for normality, but RMANOVA was still used to compare models due to its resiliency to deviations from normality. 
A significant difference was found between predicting different numbers of PCs (F=1595.0, p<0.001), predicting between the two variable sets (F=81.6, p<0.001), and the interaction between both factors (F=213.7, p<0.001). 
Significant differences were found between all three levels of the predicted number of PCs (p-adj<0.001) with a Tukey post-hoc HSD test.
No significant difference was found between the two variable sets (p-adj=0.42).
Therefore, the model predicting 8 PCs with the selected variable set was chosen for its simplicity and performance. 

![Distribution of errors across the various prediction models leave-subject-out cross-validation results. Model RMSE mean and standard deviation are shown above each distribution](../fig/SA2/modelPerformance.png){#fig:modelperf  }

Each retained PC is a shape mode in the model. ([Fig. @fig:coefs]) shows the chosen model's normalized regression coefficient values for each shape mode. 
The coefficients for the sex predictor are not shown as they were calculated to be zero for every shape mode.

![Each graph represents the predictor's effects on the shape mode by visualizing the model's normalized coefficients. Larger absolute values indicate a larger effect from the predictor on the shape mode.](../fig/SA2/coefs.png){#fig:coefs  }



([Fig. @fig:pca_quad]) shows each shape mode's axis represented on the mean foot, highlighting which areas of the foot are affected by deformations in each shape mode. 
([Fig. @fig:pca_overlay]) shows the $\pm$ 2 standard deviations of deformation along each shape mode overlaid on the mean foot. 
Supplementary information includes correlation between figures, ratio of total variance each retained PC accounts for, and a video showing the predictive capability of the model.

This study was designed to construct and evaluate a parametric SSM in  explaining and predicting dynamic foot morphology changes across the subject population. 
The model was able to predict dynamic foot shape across the subject population with an average RMSE of 5.2 $\pm$ 2.0 mm. For context, if all possible prediction error was accumulated to only affect length and width, it would be higher than the half-size step of the American shoe sizing system [@Luximon2013], but less than inter-brand variability of shoe length and shoe width [@Wannop2019].
Further, this error is lower than the RMSEs of other parametric SSMs that predicted static standing child body shape (mean=10.4mm) [@Park2015a], dynamic shoulder deformation (mean=11.98mm) [@Kim2016] and child torso shape (mean=9.5mm) [@Park2017]. Note though, that the presented model may have lower prediction errors due to the foot being a relatively smaller section of the body to model. Grant et al's model reconstructed internal foot bones with much lower RMSEs from sparse anatomical landmarks (1.21-1.66 mm for various foot segments) [@Grant2020] but was trained with higher resolution MRI images. Other efforts to create statistical foot shape models did not incorporate parametric prediction of foot shape [@Conrad2019; @Stankovic2020]. 

### Foot Shape Changes

The first, second, and fourth shape modes, accounting for a total of 86.7% of total variance, capture gross foot motion.
Foot motion during stance is dominated by MTP and ankle dorsi/plantarflexion [@Leardini2007], which is captured in the first shape mode ([@fig:pca_overlay]).
The second and fourth shape modes capture gross changes in foot rotation from frontal and transverse plane movements at the MTP and ankle joints, respectively ([@fig:pca_overlay]). 
The second shape mode is most affected by foot inversion/everison around the MTP joint. 
The second shape mode also captures girth scaling at the ankle joint, as seen in ([@fig:pca_overlay]) by how the ankle girth decreases along the axis, and is affected by weight ([@fig:coefs]).
The fourth shape mode is affected by ankle inversion/eversion and internal/external rotation. 
Foot inversion/eversion, ankle inversion/eversion, and ankle internal/external rotation are expected to vary across the stance phase ([@Leardini2007]), which leads to the observed changes in gross movement. 
However, the second and fourth shape modes are slightly affected by foot length, which may suggest inter-individual effects in foot inversion/eversion, ankle inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation during gait.
There is a slight correlation between these angles and foot length (see supplementary figures), which may be due to differences in cadence when walking at the treadmill's set speed.
Individuals were given time to acclimate to the treadmill's set speed, but the speed may not have been their preferred walking speed. 

The third shape mode captures foot shape scaling at the rearfoot, as highlighted in ([@fig:pca_quad]).
Foot length shrinks when moving positively along the third shape mode ([@fig:pca_overlay]), and thus has a negative effect from foot length.
There are also negative effects from foot width and weight, which may be due to their correlation to foot length (see supplementary figures).
Rearfoot morphology along this shape mode has a more rounded shape in the negative direction, and a sharper shape in the positive direction ([@fig:pca_overlay]).
There is also a negative effect from foot inversion/eversion ([@fig:coefs]), indicating that with foot eversion, a sharper rearfoot shape is expected.
This may be due to foot eversion at heel-off [@Leardini2007], where the foot unloads from a rounder weight-bearing rearfoot to a sharper non-weight bearing  rearfoot shape. 

Midfoot girth increases and the rearfoot is rounder along the fifth shape mode's axis ([@fig:pca_overlay]).
The fifth shape mode is positively affected by foot length and negatively by MTP dorsi/plantarflexion ([@fig:coefs]). 
This suggests that static midfoot girth increases with foot length, and decreases through heel-off as the MTP dorsiflexes.
Rearfoot morphology is rounder for longer foot lengths but gets sharper through heel-off with MTP dorsiflexion, much like in the third shape mode.
Midfoot girth was previously found to decrease during stance phase compared to statically standing [@Grau2018], most likely due to intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscle contraction [@Scott1993; @Gefen2000]. 
However, it was not noted where during stance phase midfoot girth decreases, but it can now be assumed it occurs during heel-off. 

The sixth shape mode captures girth changes at the ankle, midfoot, and the medial MTP joint region ([@fig:pca_quad]), with girth increasing along the axis. 
There are positive effects from ankle internal/external rotation and weight, while there is a negative effect from ankle inversion/eversion ([fig:coefs]). 
Static MTP, midfoot, and ankle girth may therefore increase with subject weight.
Dynamic girth changes in these regions may occur as the ankle everts and internally rotates just prior to toe-off,  where muscle activation is needed to push the foot off the ground. 
The foot is stiffened through tension in the MTP joints in order to prepare for toe-off [@Hicks1954], and the MTP joints are known to move relatively within the foot during gait [@Wolf2008; @Lundgren2008] which may be resulting in the increased girth at the MTP joint. 
A similar mechanism may be occuring at the ankle joint during ankle inversion and internal rotation, where tension from muscle activation prior to toe-off may cause increased girth. 

The seventh and eight shape modes, accounting for 1.3% of total variance, capture girth increases near the medial malleolus along their axes ([@fig:pca_quad]).
They are both positively affected by ankle inversion/eversion ([@fig:coefs]), and the eight shape mode is further negatively affected by ankle internal/external rotation. 
This may suggest that the girth around the medial malleolus decreases prior to push-off, as the ankle everts and internally rotates. 

Observed girth changes at the ankle joint, medial malleolus, midfoot, and MTP joint can be directly mapped to footwear design recommendations for increased fit and comfort. Midfoot girth decreased as the MTP joint is dorsiflexing after heel-off.
Midfoot, ankle, and MTP joint girth increased and medial malleolus girth decreased through ankle eversion and external rotation just prior to toe-off. 
Footwear should be designed to follow these volume changes as the footwear itself goes through the same motions, to ensure proper support for the foot to drive the footwear through the stance phase and toe-off. 
For example, footwear may be designed to first contract as the MTP joint dorsiflexes, then subsequently expand around the midfoot, ankle and MTP joints while contracting around the medial malleolus as the ankle everts and externally rotates. 

### Study Limitations

A number of limitations in this study should be noted. 
The elastic-net method is able to retain cross-correlated predictors, but still requires some bias in the dataset to predict scenarios where cross-correlated predictors are independent  [@Zou2005].
Therefore, the presented model may not be valid for predicting changes in morphology due to independent changes in joint angles outside of stance phase, or for variance in foot width or weight compared to foot length not captured in the subject population. 

The model did not capture differences between male and female feet. 
Studies found that sex differences in foot shape after scaling for foot length were not significant [@Kouchi2009; @Barisch-Fritz2014a; @Conrad2019], or were small in magnitude [@Wunderlich2001;@Krauss2008].
No subject demographic data was collected to account for differences in foot shape due to ethnicity [@Jurca2019].
No data was captured on the foot's plantar surface due to limitations with the scanning system; therefore foot arch changes were not captured. 
Data captured around the toes had high noise, which necessitated smoothing the toes in the template to ease fitting.
Future advances in 4D scanning may alleviate some of these concerns, and also allow for expansion of this model to higher frequency foot motions, such as running. 

## Instep Height and Girth Analysis

One of the primary findings in this study was the decrease in midfoot girth through heel-off, but the exact change in measurement was not taken in this study. 
This region is represented by the traditional foot measurements of instep height and instep girth. 
Therefore, a in-depth sizing analysis will be conducted in collaboration with Volumental, focusing on these measurements. 
Jurca et al [@Jurca2019] found that instep height in the median 90% of the population had a range of 16.2 mm, measured from a sample of Volumental’s database. 
The model can be extended by measuring the change in instep height and instep girth  with the dynamic foot morphology model. 
Instep height will be measured across the kinematic variables, foot length, and foot width with the method outlined in Jurca et al [@Jurca2019], to maintain consistency. 
The range of dynamic instep height will then be compared to the distribution of instep height per length class, done by Jurca et al (2019).
From this analysis, it is expected that tolerances for instep height can be defined across the population; specifically, the range needed to capture the median 90% population for each foot length class.
Recommendations for how to scale instep height to foot length and foot width can then be generated. 

If desired, this analysis can be repeated for the measures of foot length, foot width, and heel width. Correlations between these and additional measures can be explored to find measurements that accurately predict foot shape. This opens the door to generating representative foot shapes for the median 90% of the population; identifying such variables will help prioritize foot measures important to footwear design and fitting.

## Summary
A 4D scanning system was developed to capture dynamic foot shape changes, and was used to collect data for development of the model. 
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first parametric foot SSM that captures and reconstructs dynamic motion.
The model was able to identity specific changes in foot morphology as they related to subject and kinematic parameters, and suggest footwear design techniques to increase fit and comfort. 
The model is able to reconstruct a full 3D model when parameter values are provided, which offers  a design starting point for constructing a planetary spacesuit boot prototype in Specific Aim 3. 

To date, all data-collection for Specific Aim 2 has been completed.
A journal paper detailing the development of the 4D scanning system was published in the Journal of Open Source Software. 
A journal paper detailing the development of the model is currently under review, and has been released as a preprint. 
The sizing analysis is just starting and will be presented in a future journal paper.
