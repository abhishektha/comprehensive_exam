# Specific Aim 2: Predictively modeling dynamic changes in foot morphology during gait

## Introduction

Designing a new spacesuit boot to be more comfortable and not be subject to fit issues like heel lift, requires a thorough understanding of foot shape. 
However, foot shape is known to be highly variable throughout the population, including by sex [@Wunderlich2001; @Krauss2008; @Krauss2010], age [@Tomassoni2014], and weight [@Price2016]. 
This variability is often not captured in terrestrial footwear sizing, as current fitting standards only use foot length, foot width, and arch length to fit to standardized shoe sizes [@ASTM2017].
Furthermore, terrestrial footwear is commonly designed around lasts, shoe molds that are sized and shaped by each manufacturer with no common standard.
This leads to variability in footwear shapes and sizes [@Jurca2013; @Wannop2019], making it hard for consumers to find a proper fit and resulting in users having to wear ill-fitting footwear with suboptimal comfort. 
Foot problems and resultant pain have been reported due to poor fit in coal mining boots [@Dobson2018b]. 
Therefore, the issue of footwear fit is not just limited to spacesuit boots, both terrestrial footwear and spacesuit boots should account for the wide variety of foot shapes to improve fit. 

In addition to foot shape variability in the population, the foot also changes shape while being loaded during gait. 
The current methodology of designing terrestrial footwear uses static lasts, assuming that the foot consists of rigid segments.
Assumptions of rigid foot segments during foot loading have shown inaccuracies in estimation of ankle joint mechanics [@Zelik2018; @Kessler2020], suggesting intra-foot motion as the foot is loaded [@Lundgren2008; @Wolf2008]. 
Evidence suggests that foot loading affects linear foot measurements, such as when transitioning from sitting to standing [@Xiong2009; @Oladipo2008] or during the stance phase of gait [@Kouchi2009; @Barisch-Fritz2014; @Grau2018].
The dynamically changing measurements suggest morphological changes occurring, all of which may not be captured in static linear and circumferential measurements. 
Thus, footwear should also be designed to account for these dynamic foot shape changes. 

Statistical shape models (SSMs) can explain morphological differences across populations and during motion by identifying shape modes which account for variance from the mean shape. 
These have been developed for whole-body digital human modeling applications to study population and individual variance in body shape [@Allen2003; @Anguelov2005; @Reed2014; @Park2015a; @Park2017]. 
Parametric SSMs are extensions which use correlations between subject anthropometric data and SSM deformations to help predict body shape for new individuals in the population [@Park2015a; @Park2017]. 
The ABF at NASA developed parametric SSMs to characterize shoulder shape deformation across the shoulder's range-of-motion, predicting shape as a function of shoulder orientation, to validate HUT design [@Kim2016;@Kim2019].
However, the technology used to capture the body scans for this SSM could not capture the dynamic natural motion of the shoulder; subjects had to pose their shoulder at specific orientations while a scan was taken. 

SSMs have recently been applied to characterize static foot shape across a population [@Conrad2019] and recognize foot-shape deviations [@Stankovic2020].
The aforementioned efforts to capture foot measurement changes over the gait cycle did capture 4D foot images at high framerates [@Barisch-Fritz2014;@Grau2018], but these efforts were not translated into a SSM. 
Previously developed systems were based on a catwalk, requiring subjects to correctly hit the scanning area for a successful data capture, which may not be representative of natural cadence. 
However, the systems used to capture 4D foot shape are very expensive and cannot be used around a treadmill, which allows for subjects to fall into natural gait.
No SSMs have been developed from previous capture of 4D foot scans to predict dynamic foot shape 

Therefore, the objectives of this specific aim are:

-  develop a low-cost 4D scanning system capable of capturing foot shape around a treadmill
-  create a predictive model of foot shape changes across the dorsal surface during stance phase
-  identify specific areas of the foot that change shape during stance phase 
-  correlate changes in foot shape across large-scale population foot measurements

## DynaMo: Dynamic Body Shape Capture with Intel RealSense Cameras

Human body shape can be captured with a variety of methodologies, including laser lines, structured light, photogrammetry, and millimeter waves [@Daanen2013].
However, these technologies require expensive modules and have limited ability to capture dynamic changes in body shape. 
Motion capture with specific markers is commonly done through camera-based motion tracking [@Windolf2008]
These systems for marker tracking are often cost prohibitive and unable to capture surface morphology.

Therefore, the DynaMo software library was developed to use multiple commercial depth cameras, the Intel RealSense DXX Depth Cameras (Intel, Santa Clara CA), retailing between $150-$200, to capture dynamic body shape changes. 
The Intel RealSense Depth cameras use two stereo image sensors along with a structured light projector to capture depth maps at 90 frames-per-second; each pixel in a depth map records the distance from the camera to the world.
DynaMo includes functions to calibrate a capture volume, using a checkerboard to identify a common origin between multiple depth cameras ([@fig:testSetup]). 
DynaMo calculates a common point cloud from the depth maps of all the connected cameras, outputting a point cloud for every frame captured by all connected cameras ([@fig:SA2-sampleFrames]). 
Functions were also developed to track the position of reflective markers in the scene.
The development of DynaMo was published in a journal paper [@Boppana2019].

## Development of a Predictive Dynamic Foot Shape Model from Statistical Shape Modeling

The development of the DynaMo software [@Boppana2019] allowed for a capturing of foot shape to develop a parametric SSM.
This system captures  foot morphology changes during loading and unloading on the foot's dorsal surface, but does not capture of the foot's plantar surface. 
A parametric SSM was developed which can characterize and predict dynamic foot morphology at specific points during stance phase across the subject population. 

### Methods

#### Subjects

A total of 30 healthy subjects (15 men and 15 women, ages 23.1 $\pm$ 3.7) participated in this study.
Subjects were recruited in a stratified sample into one of six groups (5 subjects per group) to maximize variance in population foot length. 
Height was used as the grouping factor since height is well correlated to foot length [@Giles1991]. The general population may not know offhand their exact foot length, and shoe size varies by manufacturer and does not correspond directly to foot length [@Jurca2013; @Wannop2019]. Groups consisted of 5th-35th, 35th-65th, and 65th-95th height percentiles for each sex. 
Height percentile values were taken from the ANSUR II survey [@Gordon2014] and converted to imperial units as it was expected most subjects would report their height in imperial units. 
Population recruitment groups are summarized in [@tbl:groups].  

| Sex    | 5th-35th percentile Height | 35th-65th percentile Height | 65th-95th percentile Height |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Female | 4'11"-5'3"                 | 5'3"-5'5"                   | 5'5"-5'8"                   |
| Male   | 5'4"-5'8"                  | 5'8"-5'11"                  | 5'11"-6'2"                  |

: Enrollment groups based on reported height. 5 subjects were enrolled in each group {#tbl:groups}


Prior to recruitment, subjects completed a prescreening survey to ensure they were adequately healthy by the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines[@Riebe2015], and between the ages of 18-65.
Subjects provided their sex and height, and were only enrolled in the study if their population group was not fully enrolled. 

#### Experimental Procedures

The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Review Board.
Procedures were explained to each subject and written consent was obtained prior to participation. 
Subjects’ height and weight were recorded with a tape measure and scale, respectively. 
Subjects’ foot length, foot width, and arch length were measured with a Brannock device (The Brannock Device Company, Liverpool, NY) [@ASTM2017].
Both foot length and arch length were measured in centimeters.
Foot width was measured as an ordinal size (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), and then converted to a linear measurement in centimeters (The Brannock Device Company, Liverpool, NY).

Six Intel RealSense D415 Depth Cameras (Intel, Santa Clara, CA) were placed and calibrated around a custom-built level treadmill in the University of Colorado Boulder Locomotion Laboratory, as shown in [@fig:testSetup].
The treadmill was set to an average walking pace of 1.4 m/s [@Browning2006].
Reflective markers were placed on the subject's right foot and a black sock over their left foot to aid in right foot identification.
Subjects first walked for one minute to warm-up and fall into a natural cadence. 
The operator then collected 10 seconds of data to capture approximately 10 steps.
The data were reviewed to ensure the subject stayed in frame from heel-strike to toe-off during capture. If needed, the subject’s placement was shifted and data was collected again, up to two times.

#### Data Processing

[Figure @fig:dataflow] provides an overview of the data processing workflow; all steps are summarized in the paragraphs below. 

![Flowchart of processing steps for statistical shape model creation](../fig/SA2/footProcessing.png){#fig:dataflow width="100%"}

For each subject, a candidate heel-strike to toe-off event was manually identified across all captures by taking into account point cloud quality due to the high computational power required to process all heel-strike to toe-off events. 
The depth images captured by each depth camera were processed into point clouds using the DynaMo package [@Boppana2019].
From each point cloud, the right foot was isolated and transformed into a triangle mesh [@Rusu2011; @Fischler1981;@Bernardini1999;@Zhou2018].
Since every depth image was captured independently by the cameras, the amount and location of points which represented the foot were not consistent. 
In addition, the captured data may have holes in the surface representing the foot. 
Registration of all scans to a common template represents every scan by an equal number of points, and ensures any missing points are properly interpolated. 
The right foot meshes were then iteratively registered using a three-step fitting process to an averaged high-quality static template scan from a previous study [@Reed2013].
First scans were roughly aligned using a point-to-plane iterative-closest-point algorithm [@Chen1992], implemented in Open3D [@Zhou2018].
Next, the radial-basis function fitting algorithm from the GIAS2 software package [@Zhang2016] was run twice using a thin-plate spline to approximate the foot surface [@Park2015a; @Kim2016]. 
The mid-stance scan from each subject was registered first to the template, and then the registration process was run both forwards towards toe-off and backwards towards heel-strike, on a scan-by-scan basis, using the previously registered scan as a template for the next scan. 
Accuracy was checked by comparing registered scans with the processed scans by finding corresponding points between both, and calculating the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between the corresponding points. 

Anatomical landmarks can be reliably approximated from the registered scans [@VandenHerrewegen2014b]. 
The first metatarsal head, fifth metatarsal head, and second toe landmarks were used to align all scans to be centered at the second metatarsal head, with the forward axis pointing towards the second toe.
Landmarks around the metatarsal-phalangeal (MTP) joint and ankle joint were used to calculate ankle, MTP, and foot kinematics for each subject's scans with respect to the joint angles at the subject's mid-stance scan.
Relevant joint angles include dorsi/plantarflexion, ankle inversion/eversion, ankle internal/external rotation,  MTP dorsi/plantarflexion, foot inversion/eversion, and foot internal/external rotation angles.

#### Model Construction

Principal component (PC) analysis is a dimensionality-reduction method commonly in constructing SSMs [@Reed2008; @Park2015a; @Conrad2019; @Stankovic2020].
The first PC represents an axis containing the largest variance in the dataset, and each subsequent PC describes the largest variance orthogonal to the previous component's axis. 
Therefore, PCs allow for a new, smaller set of orthogonal variables to be defined which represent the variance in the dataset.

Let $N$ equal the number of total scans in the dataset, and $n=29873$ equal the number of vertices in each registered scan. The scikit-learn module [@JMLR:v12:pedregosa11a] was used to incrementally calculate the maximum $N$ PCs which represent the dataset.
Each scan in the dataset is represented in the PC model with $N$ PC scores. 
All PC scores are centered around 0, which represents the mean foot scan of the dataset containing all subjects. 
Each PC represents a shape mode in the SSM, where each score represents a deviation from the mean foot along the shape mode axis. The resultant PC model can be used to inverse transform a vector of length $N$ PC scores into a $29873\times 3$ vector, which represents the location of the vertices in the foot shape. Not all PCs were retained in the model since the first few PCs explain a majority of the variance, while additional PCs may be accounting for noise.

Subject demographic data and calculated joint angles were incorporated into the SSM by developing multivariate linear regression models based on these features. 
This was used to predict each PC score, which can then be inverse-transformed into a foot shape.
Subject demographic data and joint angles were normalized and power-transformed to aid in regression development [@Yeo2000].
An elastic net regularization algorithm [@Zou2005] was run for each multivariate regression to calculate normalized feature coefficients for each PC score's regression. 
Two different sets of predictors were created, one with all subject demographic data and calculated joint angles, and one with the highly cross-correlated predictors of arch length, body-mass index, and height were removed. 
Six potential models were built as combinations between the number of PCs predicted which explained 95%, 98%, and 99.7% of the variance, and the two predictor sets. 


#### Model Validation

All six models were validated for performance using leave-one-out cross-validation, where scans from each subject were set as the validation set, and models were trained on the remaining dataset. 
Model performance during validation was quantified with the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted foot shape to the corresponding registered scan. 
A two-way RMANOVA analysis was run on the error distributions to test the effect of constructing a predictor with the different number of PCs, and between using the two variable sets. 
The chosen model was retrained on the whole dataset before being analyzed. 

### Results

A total of 1771 scans were analyzed across all 30 subjects. 
The average number of scans collected for each subject's stance phase was 59 $\pm$ 3.7, with a range of 52-69 scans due to inter-individual differences in stride length. 
[Figure @fig:scans] shows a set of raw and registered scans from one subject.
All processed scans were registered to the template with a median registration accuracy of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.6 mm.

![Processed and registered scans of one subject during heel-off, shown 10 frames (0.11 seconds) apart.](../fig/SA2/scans.png){#fig:scans width="80%"}

The PCA analysis of all registered scans found the first 8 PCs to represent approximately 95% of the variance, the first 27 PCs to represent approximately 98% of the variance, and the first 105 PCs to represent approximately 99.7% of the variance. 
[Figure @fig:modelperf] shows the distribution of cross-validation RMSEs for each of the six elastic net regression models tested. 
RMSE distributions did not meet assumptions for normality, but RMANOVA was still used to compare models due to its resiliency to deviations from normality. 
A significant difference was found between predicting different numbers of PCs (F=1595.0, p<0.001), predicting between the two variable sets (F=81.6, p<0.001), and the interaction between both factors (F=213.7, p<0.001). 
Significant differences were found between all three levels of the predicted number of PCs (p-adj<0.001) with a Tukey post-hoc HSD test.
No significant difference was found between the two variable sets (p-adj=0.42).
Therefore, the model predicting 8 PCs with the selected variable set was chosen for its simplicity and performance.

Each retained PC is a shape mode in the model. [Figure @fig:SA2-coefs] shows the chosen model's normalized regression coefficient values for each shape mode. 
The coefficients for the sex predictor are not shown as they were calculated to be zero for every shape mode.

This study was designed to construct and evaluate a parametric SSM in  explaining and predicting dynamic foot morphology changes across the subject population. 
The model was able to predict dynamic foot shape across the subject population with an average RMSE of 5.2 $\pm$ 2.0 mm. For context, if all possible prediction error was accumulated to only affect length and width, it would be higher than the half-size step of the American shoe sizing system [@Luximon2013], but less than inter-brand variability of shoe length and shoe width [@Wannop2019].
Further, this error is lower than the RMSEs of other parametric SSMs that predicted static standing child body shape (mean=10.4mm) [@Park2015a], dynamic shoulder deformation (mean=11.98mm) [@Kim2016] and child torso shape (mean=9.5mm) [@Park2017]. Note though, that the presented model may have lower prediction errors due to the foot being a relatively smaller section of the body to model. Grant et al.'s model reconstructed internal foot bones with much lower RMSEs from sparse anatomical landmarks (1.21-1.66 mm for various foot segments) [@Grant2020] but was trained with higher resolution MRI images. Other efforts to create statistical foot shape models did not incorporate parametric prediction of foot shape [@Conrad2019; @Stankovic2020]. 

### Foot Shape Changes

The first, second, and fourth shape modes, accounting for a total of 86.7% of total variance, capture gross foot motion.
Foot motion during stance is dominated by MTP and ankle dorsi/plantarflexion [@Leardini2007], which is captured in the first shape mode ([@fig:pca_all]).
The second and fourth shape modes capture gross changes in foot rotation from frontal and transverse plane movements at the MTP and ankle joints, respectively ([@fig:pca_all]). 
The second shape mode is most affected by foot inversion/eversion around the MTP joint. 
The second shape mode also captures girth scaling at the ankle joint, as seen in ([@fig:pca_all]) by how the ankle girth decreases along the axis, and is affected by weight ([@fig:SA2-coefs]).
The fourth shape mode is affected by ankle inversion/eversion and internal/external rotation. 
Foot inversion/eversion, ankle inversion/eversion, and ankle internal/external rotation are expected to vary across the stance phase ([@Leardini2007]), which leads to the observed changes in gross movement. 
However, the second and fourth shape modes are slightly affected by foot length, which may suggest inter-individual effects in foot inversion/eversion, ankle inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation during gait.
There is a slight correlation between these angles and foot length (see supplementary figures), which may be due to differences in cadence when walking at the treadmill's set speed.
Individuals were given time to acclimate to the treadmill's set speed, but the speed may not have been their preferred walking speed. 

The third shape mode captures foot shape scaling at the rearfoot, as highlighted in ([@fig:pca_all]).
Foot length shrinks when moving positively along the third shape mode ([@fig:pca_all]), and thus has a negative effect from foot length.
There are also negative effects from foot width and weight, which may be due to their correlation to foot length (see supplementary figures).
Rearfoot morphology along this shape mode has a more rounded shape in the negative direction, and a sharper shape in the positive direction ([@fig:pca_all]).
There is also a negative effect from foot inversion/eversion ([@fig:SA2-coefs]), indicating that with foot eversion, a sharper rearfoot shape is expected.
This may be due to foot eversion at heel-off [@Leardini2007], where the foot unloads from a rounder weight-bearing rearfoot to a sharper non-weight bearing  rearfoot shape. 

Midfoot girth increases and the rearfoot is rounder along the fifth shape mode's axis ([@fig:pca_all]).
The fifth shape mode is positively affected by foot length and negatively by MTP dorsi/plantarflexion ([@fig:SA2-coefs]). 
This suggests that static midfoot girth increases with foot length, and decreases through heel-off as the MTP dorsiflexes.
Rearfoot morphology is rounder for longer foot lengths but gets sharper through heel-off with MTP dorsiflexion, much like in the third shape mode.
Midfoot girth was previously found to decrease during stance phase compared to statically standing [@Grau2018], most likely due to intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscle contraction [@Scott1993; @Gefen2000]. 
However, it was not noted where during stance phase midfoot girth decreases, but it can now be assumed it occurs during heel-off. 

The sixth shape mode captures girth changes at the ankle, midfoot, and the medial MTP joint region ([@fig:pca_all]), with girth increasing along the axis. 
There are positive effects from ankle internal/external rotation and weight, while there is a negative effect from ankle inversion/eversion ([fig:SA2-coefs]). 
Static MTP, midfoot, and ankle girth may therefore increase with subject weight.
Dynamic girth changes in these regions may occur as the ankle everts and internally rotates just prior to toe-off,  where muscle activation is needed to push the foot off the ground. 
The foot is stiffened through tension in the MTP joints in order to prepare for toe-off [@Hicks1954], and the MTP joints are known to move relatively within the foot during gait [@Wolf2008; @Lundgren2008] which may be resulting in the increased girth at the MTP joint. 
A similar mechanism may be occurring at the ankle joint during ankle inversion and internal rotation, where tension from muscle activation prior to toe-off may cause increased girth. 

The seventh and eight shape modes, accounting for 1.3% of total variance, capture girth increases near the medial malleolus along their axes ([@fig:pca_all]).
They are both positively affected by ankle inversion/eversion ([@fig:SA2-coefs]), and the eight shape mode is further negatively affected by ankle internal/external rotation. 
This may suggest that the girth around the medial malleolus decreases prior to push-off, as the ankle everts and internally rotates. 

The observed girth changes at the ankle joint, medial malleolus, midfoot, and MTP joint can be directly mapped to spacesuit footwear design recommendations to reduce instances of heel-lift. 
During heel-lift, the heel rises inside the boot, resulting in the midfoot rotating upward around the MTP-joint much like after the heel-off phase in gait. 
This can only occur if there is empty space above the midfoot; if the boot's internal shape were perfectly fit to the foot's shape, the foot would not be allowed to move inside the boot. 
Unlike some terrestrial footwear which can rely on the elasticity of uppers to continuously capture the foot, the stiff nature of a pressurized spacesuit boots does not allow for its upper to continuously conform to the foot if the foot changes shape. 
The study showed that midfoot girth decreased as the MTP joint is dorsiflexing after heel-off in the fifth shape mode. 
Therefore, a spacesuit boot should have a mechanism to conform to this volume change to reduce empty space above the midfoot and therefore reduce instances of heel-lift. 
Heel counters are also designed into many terrestrial boots to ensure the heel stays index through motion; a well-designed heel-counter could also help reduce heel-lift.
Rearfoot morphology changed from a rounded shape to a sharper shape with MTP joint dorsiflexion in the fifth shape mode, suggesting that a heel-counter may need to account for this shape change to properly capture the heel. 
A combination of midfoot capture and an improved heel-counter that account for these morphological changes can work together to reduce instances of heel-lift in the spacesuit boot. 

### Study Limitations

A number of limitations in this study should be noted. 
The elastic-net method is able to retain cross-correlated predictors, but still requires some bias in the dataset to predict scenarios where cross-correlated predictors are independent  [@Zou2005].
Therefore, the presented model may not be valid for predicting changes in morphology due to independent changes in joint angles outside of stance phase, or for variance in foot width or weight compared to foot length not captured in the subject population. 

The model did not capture differences between male and female feet. 
Studies found that sex differences in foot shape after scaling for foot length were not significant [@Kouchi2009; @Barisch-Fritz2014a; @Conrad2019], or were small in magnitude [@Wunderlich2001;@Krauss2008].
No subject demographic data was collected to account for differences in foot shape due to ethnicity [@Jurca2019].
No data was captured on the foot's plantar surface due to limitations with the scanning system; therefore foot arch changes were not captured. 
Data captured around the toes had high noise, which necessitated smoothing the toes in the template to ease fitting.
Future advances in 4D scanning may alleviate some of these concerns, and also allow for expansion of this model to higher frequency foot motions, such as running. 

## Instep Height and Girth Analysis

While the dynamic foot shape model provides insight into how regions of the foot change shape due to motion or anthropometry, it only outputs foot shapes and not linear or circumferential foot measurements. 
One of the primary findings in this study was the decrease in midfoot girth through heel-off; this region is represented by the linear foot measurements of instep height and instep girth. 
Translating the foot-shape changes in the midfoot to linear measurements will provide a basis for footwear designers to ensure their uppers have the range to conform to the midfoot throughout gait. 
Specifically for this thesis, this linear measurement will provide a baseline for engineering a conformable upper into a spacesuit boot to reduce empty space above the midfoot and thereby reduce heel lift. 
In addition, comparing dynamic changes in these measures to their static population range will allow for future sizing analyses to include how much instep height conformal range is needed for each shoe size. 

Volumental AG, a footwear research company, has developed a database of 1.2 million footwear consumer static foot scans around the world [@Jurca2019].
Analysis of this database showed that static instep height in the median 90% of the population had a range of 16.2 mm [@Jurca2019]. 
In collaboration with Volumental AG, The dynamic foot shape model will be expanded to output instep height measurements, with the method outlined in Jurca et al. [@Jurca2019], across the kinematic variables, foot length, and foot width of the dynamic model's subject population. 
When compared to the static measurements done by Jurca et al. [@Jurca2019], tolerances for instep height can be defined across the population; specifically, the range needed to capture the median 90% population for each foot length class.
This analysis will be repeated for instep girth. 

As a stretch goal, this analysis can be repeated for the measures of foot length, foot width, and heel width. 
While this goal is not a thesis contribution, this opens the door to understanding how foot much footwear needs to be conformal to the user's foot shape; identifying variables that will help prioritize footwear design measures. 

## Summary
A 4D scanning system was developed to capture dynamic foot shape changes, and was used to collect data for development of the model. 
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first parametric foot SSM that captures and reconstructs dynamic motion.
The model was able to identity specific changes in foot morphology as they related to subject and kinematic parameters, and suggest spacesuit boot design techniques to reduce instances of heel-lift.
Along with these techniques, the model is able to reconstruct a full 3D model when parameter values are provided, which offers a design starting point for constructing a planetary spacesuit boot prototype in Specific Aim 3. 

To date, all data-collection for Specific Aim 2 has been completed.
A journal paper detailing the development of the 4D scanning system was published in the Journal of Open Source Software [@Boppana2019]. 
A journal paper detailing the development of the model is currently under review, and has been released as a preprint [@Boppana2020b]. 
The instep height and instep girth analysis is just starting and will be presented in a future journal paper.
