# Execution Plan

Through many advancements of planetary EVA spacesuit design, operator-spacesuit coordination is still not perfectly matched. 
Poor mobility and poor fit between the operator and spacesuit are some of the most common factors that can lead to injury. 
The boot subsystem of the MK III has shown to not be properly fit or match the mobility of the ankle, creating a phenomenon known as heel-lift. 
This research showed the capability of heel-off detection differences between the operator and spacesuit to indicate presence of heel-lift during gait. 
The dynamic foot shape model developed in this work can predict and provides insight into how the foot moves and changes during stance phase. 
A design framework was proposed to design a planetary EVA spacesuit boot that incorporates exisiting knowledge on foot mobility with the dynamic foot shape model. 
A prototype spacesuit boot will be designed around this framework, and be tested for comfort and mobility against a standard Earth hiking boot and a MK III-inspired pressurized boot. 
Results from this testing will validate the use of dynamic body shape models in spacesuit component design, while the framework and model will provide a path to create the models and design spacesuit components from them.

## Academic Requirements

All required coursework was completed as of the Spring 2020 semester. Of the 36 required credits, 30 were taken in ASEN, with 12 at the 6000 level. MCEN 5228 (Modeling Human Movement) and APPM 5590 (Statistical Modeling) were taken outside of ASEN. The 6 required math credits were exceeded with taking ASEN 5519 (Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis), APPM 5590 (Statistical Modeling), and ASEN 5044 (Statistical Estimation for Dynamical Systems). As of the Fall 2020 semester, 15 out of the 30 required Doctoral dissertation credits have been taken. The remaining 15 credits will be evenly taken during the Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022 semesters. The teaching practicum has been fulfilled through the mentoring of UROP students in the Summer 2018, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 semesters. A  TA position is also expected in Fall 2021.
