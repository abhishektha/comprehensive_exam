# Motivation {#chapter:motiv}

The Apollo missions represent the last time humans set foot on another planetary surface, the Moon. 
Future human spaceflight missions are retargeting planetary surface exploration by sending astronauts back to the Moon and onward to Mars.
Planetary missions' goals include but are not limited to performing scientific experiments, collecting geological samples, and constructing infrastructure to support human life. 
While many of these duties may be completed by robotic missions, human exploration still plays a key role in the success of planetary missions [@Drake2010].

An important component of planetary mission design is extravehicular activity (EVA), where astronauts conduct their duties outside their habitat.
During EVA, astronauts are subject to many physiological and environment factors, including reduced gravity loading, dust, radiation, and thermal environment.
In addition, the planetary atmosphere is not sufficient to prove life support.
Spacesuits are designed to both provide life support and help protect the astronaut against these extremes during an EVA.

Humankind's current planetary EVA experience is limited to a total of 78 hours over 15 Apollo missions [@Portree1997].
During the Apollo missions, astronauts performed almost 10 hours of EVA in a 24 hour period without the assistance of a rover during Apollo 14, and 22 hours of EVA in a 36-hour period with the assistance of a rover during Apollo 17 [@Portree1997].
Ambulation is one of the top priorities for planetary mission designs. 
The longest traverse performed on the lunar surface occurred during Apollo 12, where astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean walked 1.8 km [@Portree1997].
Apollo 15-17 missions involving a rover assumed astronauts would be able to walk 5 km in case of rover failure [@Portree1997].
Future planetary mission design assumes astronauts can walk up to 10 kilometers to return to their habitat, and that astronauts can perform 8-hour EVAs, with a limit of 12 hours of EVA per 24 hours and 24 hours of EVA per 7 days [@Drake2010].
In addition, NASA's current planetary exploration plans focus on extended stays and colonization, increasing the mission time on the surface, and therefore increasing the total amount of EVA performed by an astronaut during their stay. 
Future planetary EVA missions will therefore need a spacesuit able to adequately and comfortably protect astronauts on these long duration missions. 

## EMU Spacesuit Injury Incidence

Crewmember difficulties with the spacesuit have existed since the first EVA, where Alexi Leonov had difficulties moving the suit to re-enter the spacecraft. 
Apollo astronauts have commented on the fatiguing reduced mobility of their spacesuits [@Scheuring2008].
Gas pressurized spacesuits are known to be inherently stiff and rigid [@Parry1966;@Abramov1994;@Schmidt2001a;@Holschuh2009], difficult to move [@Norcross2009;@Amick2015], and have the potential to cause injuries both during operations and ground-based training [@Williams2003;@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2008;@Scheuring2009;@Chappell2017].

The prevelance of injury has been well studied in the era of on-orbit microgravity EVAs performed wth the Extra-Vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). 
Strauss [@Strauss2004] found that 24.6% of training sessions at the Neutral Bouancy Laboratory (NBL) between 2004 to 2006 study had reported injury symptoms. 
Viegas [@Viegas2004] found a 67.5% reporting rate of injury symptoms from astronauts training in the NBL between 2002 to 2003. 
An in-flight injury incidence of 0.24 was reported by Scheuring [@Scheuring2012] for EVAs occuring on Space Shuttle flights 90 to 113. 
These injuries can be broken down into contact and musculoskeletal injuries. 


### Spacesuit Contact Injuries
Spacesuit contact injuries, including bruises and abrasions, have been the most reported operational injury mechanism in the US space program [@Scheuring2008]. 
Contact injuries occur through repeated contact between the wearer and the
spacesuit. 
High contact pressure between the wearer and spacesuit can lead to bruises, while shear can lead to abrasions [@Mailler2004;@Carlson2006].
Reviewing reported injury incidences shows that contact injuries are the most common injuries reported in the EMU [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004; @Scheuring2012].

The hands were the most frequently reported location of EMU contact injury symptoms in all three injury analyses.
Hand contact injuries include fingernail delamination, abrasions, contusions, and nerve impingement [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004; @Scheuring2012]. 
These injuries have widely been attributed to the poor fit and unprotected contacts between the hand and the spacesuit glove [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004]. 
Viegas reports a specific mechanism where the high exertion required to actuate the glove results in dorsal displacement of the metacarpophalangeal joints, pushing the tops of fingers against the surface of the glove and causing inflammation [@Viegas2004].
EVA hand injuries have been reported since the Apollo era, with symptoms including from swollen and abrased joints that were at risk for ending the EVA [@Scheuring2012]. 

Shoulder injuries, the second most common EMU injury location, occur during ground-based training in the NBL when the wearer is inverted in the suit [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004]. 
While the wearer may be neutrally bouyant, they are still under the effects of gravity. 
Therefore, they "fall" into the suit, and are now making contact with the hard upper torso (HUT). 
The combination of unprotected contact and high loading from supporting their own body weight results in shoulder contact injuries [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004]. 

The feet are the next most reported areas of in-flight EMU contact injuries in the spacesuit [@Scheuring2012]. 
Traditionally, not much motion occurs in the lower torso of the EMU spacesuit due to its design targeting microgravity operations. 
The feet are normally restrained in a fixed foot restraint, while the astronaut performs tasks utilizing their upper body. 
One astronaut reports a "searing, knife-like pain" on their foot during on-orbit EVA which was unable to be rectified[@Scheuring2012].
This resulted in a blister and decreased sensation on the foot's dorsal surface, and was later attributed to having excess presssure bladder material in the boot [@Scheuring2012]. 
Strauss [@Strauss2004] also reports contact injuries on the toes and dorsal surface stemming from the boot sizing insert, which does not adequately project the astronaut from contact from the foot restraint or bladder folds. 

EMU Contact injuries also occur at the elbow, knee, and trunk [@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2012]. Injuries at wearer's elbows and knees are reported to come from rubbing against the convolute joints [@Strauss2004]. 
Injuries at the trunk are reported to occur from contact between the wearer's back and the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) in the spacesuit [@Strauss2004]. 

### Spacesuit Musculoskeletal Injuries

Musculoskeletal injuries, including muscle tears, strains, and inflammation, are severe injuries stemming from high exertion and poor joint programming in the spacesuit. Fatigue from high exertion may also lead to injuries.

EMU Musculoskeletal injuries have been reported in the hands, due to the high exertion needed to actuate fingers on the pressurized glove [@Viegas2004].
Fatigue may occur after many hours of completing EVA tasks [@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2012].
Similarly, the elbow joints in the EMU have also reportedly caused strains [@Strauss2004].

The most severe EMU musculoskeletal injuries have occured at the shoulder [@Strauss2004]. 
Some of these injuries have manifested into rotator cuff tears, requiring surgical intervention [@Strauss2005]. 
These injuries were attributed to the shoulder being forced by the HUT into internal rotation to perform certain tasks. 
As a result, EMU wearers overuse their rotator cuff, which are normally only used to stabilize the joint, leading to injuries [@Williams2003].

## Hypothesized Spacesuit Injury Mechanisms

The contact and musculoskeletal injuries reported in the EMU can be linked to specific deficiencies in suit design and suit compatibility. 
Poor suit fit can directly contribute to contact injuries.
Spacesuits in the Apollo era were custom tailored to each astronaut. 
However, as the astronaut corp grew, the EMU presented a modular sizing system, where differently-sized suit components had to be selected for each astronaut. 
Gaps between the wearer and the spacesuit could lead to excessive contact when the wearer moves and shifts inside the spacesuit [@Benson2009]. 
Suit components which are too small can also cause higher contact pressures, leading to potential contact injuries. 
Opperman [@Opperman2010] found that higher hand circumferences have a larger incidence of fingernail delamination in the spacesuit glove, while Charvat [@Charvat2015] found smaller hand circumferences to be a risk factor in fingernail delamination. 
This disagreement highlights how important and poorly understood fit is inside the spacesuit. 
Fit can also affect mobility; the poorly sized scye openings in the EMU's HUT limited mobility, leading to musculoskeletal injury following repeated motion [@Williams2003]. 

Poor indexing between the wearer's joint and the spacesuit's joint is a related injury mechanism. 
Poor indexing can lead to contact injuries when joint centers drift out of alignment, causing rubbing against the suit during motion. 
This was seen in the elbow and knee for the EMU [@Strauss2004].
Poor indexing is especially evident in the EMUâ€™s hard-upper torso (HUT), where the design restricts the natural movement of the shoulder joint, and required alternative movement techniques to achieve similar joint orientations [@Williams2003;@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2012].
Poor indexing can require increased exertion to move the joint [@Menendez1993].

Pressurized spacesuit joints require more energy to move [@Amick2015].
While design features aim to reduce the effort needed to bend joints [@Harris2001], these joints are difficult to engineer in areas such as the hand. 
Therefore, the fatigue and strain injuries reported in the hand could be due to inherent design deficiencies of EMU spacesuit gloves [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004]. Increased humidity can also lead to fingernail de-lamination [@Chappell2017].  

## Spacesuit Injury Countermeasures

Attempts to mitigate spacesuit injury have focused on addressing the outlined injury mechanisms. 
No perfect countermeasure has been presented for poor fit, it still remains impossible to perfectly fit every person to the EMU spacesuit due to the wide ranges of anthropometry and limited sizing components [@Benson2009]. 
Back padding on the EMU was found to potentially assist wearers in controlling the upper torso of the suit, reduce over-rotation of the torso to keep upper extremity joints aligned, and improve indexing at the gloves [@Chappell2017]. 
For wearers with a smaller anthropometry however, indexing at the hip bearings was unable to be fixed by padding, due to the limitations in torso length.
