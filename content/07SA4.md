# Specific Aim 4: Evaluation of prototype planetary spacesuit boot design for fit and comfort

## Introduction

The pressurized boot prototype developed in Specific Aim 3 will need to be validated to test the main of this thesis. 
The gold-standard of EVA mobility would be an unpressurized hiking boot. 
Current MK III boots feature only a convoluted ankle joint [@Ross2002].
The prototype will be compared against these two boot options, essentially testing the effects of boot pressurization with ankle mobility and the midfoot indexing feature designed in Specific Aim 3.
The prototype will be mated to a glovebox to allow for pressurized testing. 
If achieveable, the prototype will also be tested in walking trails outside of the glovebox. 
Since the boots will be constructed to only fit one subject, therefore, testing with multiple subjects will be difficult unless subjects with similar foot shape are found.
Regardless of test-setup, the main objectives of this work are:

- Construct interface between test boots and test environments

- Evaluate the mobility of the novel design against a standard hiking boot and pressurized hiking boot

- Evaluate the comfort of the novel design against a standard hiking boot and pressurized hiking boot



## Test Interface Construction

Interfaces will need to be constructed between the boots to be tested and the test environments. 
For the glovebox testing, the interface will need to allow for pressurization of the prototype boot and the MK III boot. 
When a vacuum is pulled inside the glovebox, the boot will become pressurized with the ambient air. 
The standard hiking boot will also need an interface to the glovebox to offer similar testing conditions, but will not need to be pressurized. 

Another potential interface will be mate the pressurized boots to the shank of the wearer.
This interface will require some sort of seal around the wearer's ankle. 
Due to expected imperfections in the seal, the boot will most likely be fed with constant pressurized air to maintain a constant pressure. 
This interface will first be tested on the practice boot constructed in SA3 before being incorporated into the prototype and MK III boot. 




## Glovebox Testing

All three boots will be mated to the glovebox, and a vacuum will be pulled to the limits of the boot design and glovebox. 
A force sensor will be placed in the heel of the boot, in as minimally intrusive position as possible.
This sensor will be used to measure for the presence of heel-lift. 
If possible, a sensor which can measure distance between the sole and heel will be selected for this application. 

The glovebox will be placed on the ground, with the subject in a standing posture.
The subject will perform range-of-motion tests of their ankle inside the glovebox.
Motions will be performed both unloaded, where the boot is free in the air, and loaded, where the boot is pushing against a flat floor.
This is consistent with previous planetary boot testing methodology [@Ross2002].
The subject will also perform a series of heel lifts to test for heel-lift. 
Range-of-motion will be measured with photogrammetry, taken from the front and side profile, and used to assess mobility 

Subjective surveys will be provided to the subject to fill after finishing the range-of-motion tests. The Corlett-Bishop Discomfort Scale [@Corlett1976], Rating of Perceived Exertion Survey [@Borg1982],  and Gravity compensation and performance scale (GCPS) [@Gernhardt2009;@Norcross2009;@Norcross2010] will be used to assess subjective comfort of the boots. 


## Stretch Testing Goals
The glovebox testing will provide initial insight into comfort and mobility, but will be limited in translation as it does not include walking. 
If a pressurized seal around the ankle is achievable, a biomechanical walking evaluation of the three boots can occur.
Walking will occur on a flat walkway, where the subject will walk across force plates to measure ground reaction forces. 
Optical motion capture will be used to capture segment kinematics of the lower torso.
A kinetic analysis from the kinematics and ground reaction forces can provide information on joint torques at the ankle, knee, and pelvis. 
The aforementioned subjective surveys will be administered following data collection with each boot. 
If spacesuit testing is available through collaborators at David Clark or NASA JSC, the prototype will be integrated into the spacesuit and similar measures will be taken. 

## Summary

This work will evaluate the fit and mobility of the boot designed in Specific Aim 3. 
Results from this work will directly inform the performance of a boot designed with body-shape modeling techniques. 
This work will not be started until Specific Aim 3 is complete, as it depends on the delivery of the prototype boot.
